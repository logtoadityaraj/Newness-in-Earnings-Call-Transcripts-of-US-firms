Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the AAR Corporation third quarter fiscal 2008 earnings call. (Operator Instructions)
I would now like to introduce your host for today's presentation Mr. John Bowman, Director of Investor Relations. Mr. Bowman, you may begin, sir.
John Bowman
Thank you, Howard. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for joining this morning's conference call.
Before we begin, we would like to remind you that certain of the comments made today relate to future events, which are forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Please refer to the forward-looking statement disclaimer contained in the press release issued last evening, as well as those factors discussed under Item 1A entitled ""Risk Factors"" included in the company's May 31st, 2007 Form 10-K. By providing forward-looking statements, the company assumes no obligation to update the forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statements or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events.
At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, David Storch.
David Storch
Thank you, John, and good morning to everyone. Joining me today is Tim Romenesko, our President and Chief Operating Officer, and Rick Poulton, our Chief Financial Officer.
Let me begin by saying that we had an exceptional quarter by virtually any measurement or dimension, where we experienced record quarterly sales, net income and earnings per share. Sales grew 39% to $376.6 million and income from continuing operations grew 31% to $20.3 million. Diluted earnings per share were $0.47 for the quarter, which included $0.01 loss per share on the early extinguishment of debt. While acquisitions contributed meaningfully to the results for the quarter, organic sales, which excludes sales growth from acquisitions, grew an impressive 25% year-over-year.
If you were to further back out the aircraft sales from both periods our growth rate would have been 19%. We achieved 10.1% operating margins and if you were to back out the effects of the acquisitions and the aircraft sales, margins on our organic business would have been 10.4%.
Sales were $151.2 million in the Aviation Supply Chain segment, an increase of 11.5% from last year, and gross margin improved 200 basis points to 24%. Gross profit increased 22% to $36.3 million. During this period, we generated sales from investments made in prior periods, which contributed to double-digit sales increase. Sales of our MRO segment grew 43% in the quarter to $74.8 million. Gross profit increased 53% to $11.1 million, resulting in a gross profit margin of 14.9%. Steady performance at our Indianapolis maintenance center and Landing Gear businesses, resulted in market share gains which drove the exceptional sales and earnings growth in this segment.
At the conclusion of the quarter, or I should say at the beginning of the new quarter, the fourth quarter, we completed the acquisition of Avborne, which will add a valuable dimension to our MRO position. The business is located at Miami International Airport, a very busy airport, with a high traffic pattern and access to international routes, and rounds out our MRO services by adding wide-body and Airbus capabilities.

We look forward to the opportunities this business brings and along these lines just last week, there was an aircraft at MIA that required a return-to-service maintenance, the aircraft was brought over to our facility. And this maintenance required landing gear repair, folks from our Landing Gear operation, about 10 miles away from MIA airport, came over to the airport and provided the repair on the landing gear, while our aircraft maintenance folks worked on the repair to the aircraft. And we're successful putting that aircraft back up into the sky same day. The customer, who is not a current customer of our heavy maintenance operations, was very pleased with the service we performed, and next week our folks would be meeting with this customer to talk about how we can capture more of their maintenance.
In the Structures and Systems segment, our organic sales growth rate was 17% fueled by strength in our mobility systems business and the overall sales growth rate in the segment was 75% after the impact of the Brown International and SUMMA acquisitions are included. Gross profit grew 84% to $16.4 million resulting in a gross profit margin of 14.8%.
During the quarter, we announced that we signed a lease to occupy 90,000 square feet in McClellan Business Park, formerly McClellan Air Force Base, in Sacramento, California for the manufacture of composite structures and parts and this is an area, where we are seeing increasing demand. We expect the business to come on line during the first quarter of our fiscal 2009.
Just to clarify, McClellan Air Force Base was closed as a result of the BRAC Base Realignment Act of 1994, and we have another operation at that air field. They became aware of this opportunity, and we were able to sieze upon it in this quarter. We will have a minimal investment and we expect that to have a very dynamic business out of that facility.
Our Aircraft Sales and Leasing segment delivered another strong quarter. As a reminder, results for our Aircraft Sales and Leasing business are reported two ways; first we purchase and sell aircraft for own account results of which flow through our income statement as sales and cost of sales. Second, we enter into aircraft transactions with partners, which are characterized as unconsolidated joint ventures and are reported within the earnings from aircraft joint ventures line our income statement.
During the third quarter, operating profit for the segment increased $3.1 million compared to year ago, even though you do see a reduction income on the face of P&L from aircraft joint ventures. The increase in operating profit of the segments reflects a gain from the sale of two of our aircraft from our own account. As of February 29th, we had a total of 37 aircraft, 29 of which are held in joint ventures and 8 of which are held in AARs fully owned portfolio.
Furthermore, I would like to comment that as a result of the financial market turmoil, we do expect more opportunities to emerge in this market. SG&A cost for the company increased in the quarter, as a result of the acquisitions and as we continued to invest in our business. However, as a percentage of sales SG&A cost declined to 9% versus 9.1% in the prior year.
Net interest expense increased to $6.1 million in the third quarter due to increased average borrowings and lower investment income. In February the company issued 250 million of convertible notes through a private placement. Proceeds after acquiring these associated note hedge and transaction fees were $215 million and were used in parts payoff the outstanding balance and our revolving credit facility, which slightly, largely related to the acquisition of SUMMA and the investments we have made in parts for our Aviation Supply Chain business.

In addition during the third quarter the remaining balance of the 2004 convertible notes of $16.4 million were converted to 880,000 shares of our common stock. These shares were already included in our share count. Subsequently, at the end of the third quarter we bought back 13 million of our 8.39% notes due in 2011. As a result of these actions, we expect interest expense to decline in the fourth quarter.
In closing I might say that we achieved double-digit sales growth in each of our segments, added a significant dimension to our Structures and Systems business mix, and strengthened our liquidity with recent financing. As we assess risk and seek opportunities like the rest of you, we're paying very close attention to capital market volatility, the economic environment in the United States and abroad, and rising oil prices and their impact on our industry and customer base.
With that, I'd like to thank you for participating on the call today, and open up the line for any questions you may have.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
(Operator Instructions)
Our first question or comment comes from the line of Troy Lahr. Mr. Lahr, your line is open.
Troy Lahr - Stifel Nicolaus & Company
Thanks. Structures and Systems had good margins. I guess you're seeing the favorable mix there towards containers. How much longer does that continue forward? Does that run forward next three quarters, four quarters, just give me some insight there?
David Storch
Yes. The mobility business has a very strong backlog. The mix is favorable. We're continuing to see opportunities for new business for new products. So, we feel good about the prospects. They're both from volume and mix for a while. Whether it's three quarters or nine quarters, I don't know, but the backlog is good for at least another year.
Troy Lahr - Stifel Nicolaus & Company
Okay. Thanks. And then, just that I'm clear you talked a little bit about outsourcing opportunities. We've been kind of waiting for some time to hear other Mesa or Chautauqua size transactions. Is the activity there increasing now that we're kind of getting into a tightening environment, the ongoing negotiation that you've had of this kind of an accelerated with some airlines or just can you update us there a little bit?
David Storch
I would say that there is a good amount of activity, some large, some medium and some small. And they run the gamut from the various customers we support. So, at this point, I think that the activity level --
Troy Lahr - Stifel Nicolaus & Company
Has it been kind of accelerating or just kind of been about the same?
David Storch
I'd say it's about the same. I think there are several opportunities that we're working on out there.
Troy Lahr - Stifel Nicolaus & Company
Okay. And then, just lastly, and then I'll jump back in the queue, can you maybe talk about the composite business that you acquired, how quickly do you think that ramps up, and maybe what markets are you targeting? I mean is this more commercial aerospace or defense type applications for composite work?
Tim Romenesko
It's not a business we acquired. It's a facility that was fully equipped by the US Air Force back in the '90s for composite manufacturing. So, we are a ""let's see if you will"" of a facility. It's a long-term lease. And as the lease progresses, the equipment inside the facility becomes the property of the company. The opportunities are in the commercial aerospace space, defense, as well as the business jet and general aviation segment. So, it's pretty much across the board.
We have, as you know, a composite business already in existence located in Clearwater, Florida. It's been very busy. It's somewhat limited by the number of autoclaves. In this particular lease, we pick up four additional autoclaves, two of which incidentally have never been turned on. So, the reason that we expect to ramp-up in our first quarter, which is beginning in June let's say, is because the facility needs to be reenergized, then reopen basically.

So, we see a fair amount of demand, or I should say excessive demand in this area. We have the talent we believe in-house. We've actually hired some additional folks to go ahead and build this into a very productive segment within AAR. To a certain extent, I think one way of looking at this business is very similar to how you might look at Indianapolis for MRO business. I think it's an opportunistic move by the company in an area that appears to be chockfull of demand.
Troy Lahr - Stifel Nicolaus & Company
Okay. Just so I'm clear then, I mean is some of the Clearwater work getting offloaded to this facility or all that work is going to stay at Clearwater?
Tim Romenesko
No, the work that's in Clearwater will stay in Clearwater, and this will be new work that we will attempt to attract. Now we might get that plan started by shifting some work elsewhere from AAR into the facility, at least, gets off and running. But once we get over the early stages, we do expect to attract new business.
Troy Lahr - Stifel Nicolaus & Company
Great. Thanks, guys.
Operator
Our next question or comment comes from the line of Larry Solow from CJS. Your line is open, sir.
Larry Solow - CJS
Good morning. Could you just maybe talk a little bit about the impact you're seeing around the major airlines cutting in domestic capacity? Recently Delta have made announcement yesterday. Would this capacity be switched to the international front or how's that going to play, how you think that will play out?
David Storch
If you take a look at the growth that we've experienced in our Aircraft Sales and Leasing segment, a lot of that growth has come from our ability to acquire aircraft in the US market, and then place those aircraft into international markets. Demand for air travel does not appear to be easing at this point in time.
As I indicated in my comments, we are obviously watching this to see what the effects of the US economy might have on domestic travel. So some of the older technology aircraft may be parked, but we do believe that if newer technology aircraft get parked they will be placed elsewhere. We view that as an opportunity both for our aircraft sales and leasing segment, as well as for our supply chain, and pass it our for MRO to put those aircraft back into service with another operator.
So, although we believe that you might have some comedown here in North America, we don't believe that worldwide travel or traffic numbers are declining.
Larry Solow - CJS
Okay. Now then a similar question just looking on the international front, would you say that -- I know we have discussed this before a lot, but with the continuing of the weakening dollar would you expect maybe more opportunities for international airliners to actually be bringing their planes in to North America for work?
David Storch
We have received some increase along those lines. We've yet to secure any business on the heavy maintenance side. We're hoping that having this Miami business will facilitate that opportunity and but time will tell. At this point in time the exchange rate obviously is favorable on this regard and it might lead to certain opportunities for the company. I would expect this, incidentally more obviously wide bodies than narrow bodies. Narrow bodies donât have go across the ponds, but we might see some opportunities along these lines.
We clearly are seeing some benefits on other businesses from the exchange rate and we are working diligently on the structures and systems business in that regard. Keep in mind, all of our manufacturing capabilities is in North America, so we do see that as a potential opportunity for the company.
Larry Solow - CJS
Great, and if you could just lastly just discuss a little bit, I believe the SUMMA acquisition if I am not mistaken was like a $100 million annualized revenue. If you could just discuss that and then the Avborne acquisition and how Avborne maybe compares to Indianapolis and I know it is small to say, but I believe the capacity is probably not as small it looks on numbers basis. So if we can just kind of compare with the annualized or potential revenues for those two acquisitions. That will be great.

David Storch
SUMMA is a very exciting acquisition for the company and that puts another leg on our stool within our Structures and Systems group. Our Structures and Systems group even today consist primarily of the mobility activity, as well as specific manufacturing of products for cargo systems and then we have a composite leg and the SUMMA gives us what we believe is the foundation for an aircraft parts manufacturing piece of our Structures and Systems group. So you are correct in terms of the annualized revenue base.
We are hoping to be able to build from that. SUMMA has very good relations, very time-tested relationships with major OEs in the aircraft manufacturing business and we are hoping to capitalize on those and be able to hopefully as result of this move in to McClellan. McClellan will be able to benefit from some of the deep ties SUMMA has with maybe this OEs. So the SUMMA acquisition if you are correct in terms of the size, but I just to want to highlight the fact that it does bring us the potential, that we did not previously have within our Structures and Systems business. So SUMMA is not a bolt-on. SUMMA is kind of adding a leg to our stool.
As it relates to Avborne, Avborne is similar in terms of basic fundamental capability within the Indianapolis, other than SUMMA has, I mean Avborne had some success on Airbus airplanes and also wide-body aircraft, the hangars are built in such a way that they can accommodate wide-body aircraft and also Avborne gives us a location that we believe is a very important location as we round out our MRO capability here in North America. So, Avborne is more of a bolt-on than Summa might be, yet Avborne does bring us certain dimensions that we didnât previously have.
Larry Solow - CJS
Okay. Great, thank you.
Operator
Our next question or comment comes from the line of Mr. Tyler Hojo from Sidoti. Your line is open.
Tyler Hojo - Sidoti
Good morning, guys. I guess this is just a follow-up to that Avborne question. I guess Rick, last conference call you provided kind of an annualized revenue figure for Summa. Would you guys be willing to do that for Avborne?
Rick Poulton
I think the number there is a little more challenging Tyler because of whether we decide to work narrow-bodies, wide-bodies, etcetera. So, I think weâll hold back from providing that number now. I think the best thing you could do is you can interpolate a little bit on the square footage base. I think, you also know, what our acquisition prices, and can sort of hone in as a multiple of revenue from that. As we get maybe a firmer mix on where we will with the workload then maybe we will better positioned to give you some better guidance.
Tyler Hojo - Sidoti
Thatâs fair. And know you provided the square footage for Avborne. What is the current capacity utilization in that facility?
Tim Romenesko
Tyler, Avborne is busy, there are kind of lot of airplanes coming in out of there. But it is not a nose-to-tail shop like your custom to see in it Indianapolis. So, one of things that we expect to bring in there is maybe not all in place, but we should allocate more of the capacities in nose-to-tail.
So, it's very busy, when I was there last week I actually have 15 aircraft around the facility, but some are in there for overnight checks, some are in for two days check, some are in there for 60 days. So, it's little difficult to characterize at the same way you might characterize Indy.
Tyler Hojo - Sidoti
Okay. Thanks for the color, Tim. And just in terms of that kind of your longstanding, longer-term margin target that has been out there 12.5%. I didn't hear you guys kind of reconfirm it. Is that still intact?
Tim Romenesko
Yes.
Tyler Hojo - Sidoti
Okay, great.
Tim Romenesko
Yeah, as we make some of these acquisitions, there is, some of these acquisitions have margins below even the 10% that we're looking at and so we have some challenges. Yeah, we view there are many opportunities to go ahead and get margin improvement.

Tyler Hojo - Sidoti
Okay, good. And just a final one, a follow-up to the first questionnaire, just in terms of the supply chain opportunities out there, I think last conference call David you mentioned that your thought something relatively meaningful could hit kind of in the back half for your fiscal year. You still stick in to that or as it maybe pushed a little bit further out to the right or any comments that would be helpful.
David Storch
Of course, half of that first, second half of the year has gone away. We didn't make any announcement.
Tyler Hojo - Sidoti
Alright.
David Storch
So, obviously we're now in the last three months. There is a possibility of at least one of these hitting this quarter, but I'd push out some of the balance just based on the -- the overall gestation period I'd push out the balance in to next year, but if I have to say, as you recall last quarter's supply chain we had sales growth of less than 10% there was 8 in change I believe. This quarter we say we will come in above -- against the double-digits we came at 11.5. There is no shortage of opportunities in that business segment and some of them are program related, some are look like programs, but we're not calling them programs, let's put it this way the pace of business is very brisk.
Tyler Hojo - Sidoti
That's fine and actually just one more for you. It look like the MRO segment, the results were terrific there. Actually, one of your competitors came out late last week and they blamed some bad weather in Oklahoma for kind of a revenue miss in their Tulsa facility. Was there any kind of negative impact in the number?
Rick Poulton
Oh, we definitely saw the bad weather.
Tyler Hojo - Sidoti
Okay.
Rick Poulton
But no significant impact in our operations.
David Storch
We didn't have the magnitude that they seem to have had.
Tyler Hojo - Sidoti
Very, good. Thanks.
David Storch
Let me just reiterate, what you said incidentally that is the growth rate within our MRO segment was truly exceptional 43% growth rate that's all organic I believe it's around as we've talked about before, it's around execution, our MRO team is executing I think beautifully and customers are very satisfied with the work load and looking for AAR to take on more work if we can and I really would like to just congratulate Tim and his team in this regard, because they're doing heck of a job, it's not -- like this business is just hanging up there for somebody to grab and this is you're talking about 43% growth rate in a market that is relatively flat. And my sense is that this is all about our team performing and getting that kind of a growth rate.
Tyler Hojo - Sidoti
Great, thanks.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Jon Braatz. Mr. Braatz, your line is open.
Jon Braatz - Kansas City Capital
Last couple of weeks, we've been hearing some stories in the press about MRO work at Southwest or issues with maintenance operations at Southwest and there is stories in Asia about Asian MRO work. How do you view that? Is that a positive maybe from a long-term standpoint, is the FAA gets a little bit tougher or are there some other issues that might develop that in more paperwork or more work for you guys. But, how do you view all this talk about MRO, I mean, the maintenance work on aircraft both domestically and internationally?
David Storch
Yeah, the MRO business is a very detailed oriented business, obviously you're talking about safety of flight and we at ARR understand that. We've been in the MRO business through our Oklahoma operation for many years. We are very focus around the detail of the work that we do, having the paperwork, having the training in place as you recall, each of our technicians receives training, pretty much every year, the last three or four years, we've received the Diamond Award from the FAA for having every technician at AAR goes to training. Now, it's a very complex putting the aircraft through a maintenance cycle is a very complex process.

In the case of Southwest, managing a fleet as wide as they are is very complex. And I think everybody has pretty much reiterated its safety record as the worldâs airlines is truly remarkable. There is a chain, if you will a safety chain. They are the major part of and this is an area that we stay very focused on and pay a lot of attention to the details, and the procedures, and the processes, and the paper work and all that kind of stuff. So, I think if you look at the world that weâre in is a kind of flight-to-quality, then I think quality providers will be in a very good position to benefit. Back here there are some folks who are not necessarily as adept or as detail-oriented as this business requires.
So, I feel very good, our head is down if you will, and weâre making certain that we have, we're doing all the things we're supposed to do and we're paying a lot of attention to this segment and it's really no different than we always have. I mean, this is as I said; itâs a very detail-oriented business and you got to pay attention to a lot of different things. And they are from time-to-time, they are slips and the important thing is that the organization has processes in place to capture these slips before they become a problem. So, I believe overall that in the general flight-to-quality lets say, as long as we continue to execute the way we are, we should be a beneficiary.
Jon Braatz - Kansas City Capital
Does the FAA have any, I guess mandate or a power to suggest, that airlines move from one provider to another or is it or kind of the sort of the mandatory type of call on the part of the FAA. So, this MRO provider is not meeting standards, you have to move.
David Storch
I believe that's within the power of FAA. The FAA has oversight and all of the licensed facilities that carry FAA designation. So they have the ability to monitor on a minutes notice. They have the ability to send staff and teams into facilities that have a certificate. They have the ability to go through their procedures to make sure they are operating within the regulations and if they deem them not to be operating within the regulations, they have the ability to pull their ticket.
Jon Braatz - Kansas City Capital
Okay.
David Storch
From time-to-time over the years, they have exercised that privilege.
Jon Braatz - Kansas City Capital
Right, okay.
David Storch
I think in terms of them officially recommending a vendor, one vendor versus another to their customers probably not in their purview. But I mean, you obviously listen when two guys are having a discussion. It probably might not be uncommon for somebody to give an opinion to somebody else and that can always happen.
Jon Braatz - Kansas City Capital
Okay, thank you very much.
David Storch
Okay.

Our next question or comment comes from the line of Alex Hamilton from Jesup & Lamont. Your line is open sir.
Alex Hamilton - Jesup & Lamont

Hi, good morning. Just, can you provide some sort of color on the sales and leasing market given the liquidity and credit concern? Has there been any change to liquidity, has there been any change to financing rate? That would be appreciated?
David Storch
Well, that's a complicated question. Let me try to answer this succinctly as I can. Clearly there is obviously at least US, maybe it is international liquidity crunch, which we are very well aware of. We are currently our fleet is fully leased. We have recently actually renegotiated a couple of leases in our favor, where the leases have rolled over and the new rate is at a higher number than the old rate.
In terms of the sales of assets in the quarter that we concluded, February 29, we were successful in selling two of our existing aircraft on a cash basis to the buyers who either had the money or financed it. And on the side of availability and I think what we are trying to signal in today's conference call, my comments was that we believe that the liquidity pressures on some of the players will create a certain amount of opportunity. And we are paying very close attention and talking with those who have been publicized to have liquidity problems on owned aircraft and those who might not be publicized but may in fact have liquidity concerns.

So we are fairly optimistic in this regard that as a result of some of the liquidity pressure that there will be aircraft opportunities for our aircraft sales and leasing business. Now we are raising our hurdle rate to take into consideration the overall risk environment. So we would anticipate kind of looking out for positive, maybe the option, the last choice let say, because we have to pay very close attention to the acquisition prices that we pay for these assets, keeping in mind our view at least of the risk profile of this market. So all of that -- what I am trying to say in this fashion, as I can say is that we are aware that there are owners of aircraft who have liquidity concerns, problems I should say and we believe we're in a good position to benefit from that.
Alex Hamilton - Jesup & Lamont
Great. Thank you.
Operator
Our next question or comment comes from the line of [Stan Mann from EMS]. Your line is open, sir.
Stan Mann - EMS
First, congratulations on a great quarter. I mean it is fantastic.
David Storch
Thank you.
Stan Mann - EMS
I have some couple of detailed questions financial. Can you give us the D&A, the regular D&A going forward and the acquisition D&A going forward. I have a couple of questions I am trying to model?
Rick Poulton
So D&As for the quarter was $10.4 million which brings you to our year-to-date, right at $30 million, just slightly shy of $30 million.
Stan Mann - EMS
Okay.
Rick Poulton
That reflects a full quarter of all the acquisitions we made, other than Avborne, which obviously just closed at the beginning of this quarter. So I think that rate for Q3 is a pretty good run rate, you have got adjust for current CapEx and then later on something for Avborne. I don't have that Avborne right now, but it tends to be the more labor intensive and capital intensive business, so it is...
Stan Mann - EMS
So it is not major. $1 million or $2 million in the quarter or something like that?
Rick Poulton
Yeah, the only caveat to that is we do have purchasing accounting to apply to the acquisition that will create some amortization. That wouldnât otherwise have been in a P&L. So I don't have that number handy. But I mean you could do based on a purchase price and some general allocations you could probably estimate that probably of course easily.
Stan Mann - EMS
Okay, what about the net debt and the diluted shares going forward?
Rick Poulton
Diluted shares is something that what you see right now in the current quarter; should not change dramatically. You have a little bit of ups and downs for either stock repurchases on our part or some option exercises or things like that. But thatâs pretty minor. It wouldnât be until we got to a much higher stock price than we're now, that you would see any dilutive effects from the recent convert we get.
Stan Mann - EMS
Is that 35, is that a 35 area orâ¦?
Rick Poulton
Little over 35, correct.
Stan Mann - EMS
And the dilution at that point would beâ¦?
Rick Poulton
It comes in under a treasury stock method of accounting. So, itâs a function of what the actual stock price is at that time.
Stan Mann - EMS
Okay.
Rick Poulton
So, you shouldnât see any real share change until you get into the $35 plus stock zone and it begins to come in slowly. On the net debt, you see from the press release, what our recourse debt looks like at this juncture. As David mentioned earlier, we did contract to, we entered into a repurchase agreement to buyback some money, some amount of our secured notes. And beyond that itâs a function of what we do with our cash and how we invest in our business. So, I think I am more comfortable telling you that gross debt, you can see that. And then we have a fair amount of cash on hand at the end of the quarter and will deploy that as we see business opportunities.

Stan Mann - EMS
Okay. Storch does it look like in India as far as buying or utilizing more space?
David Storch
Do you saying India.
Stan Mann - EMS
Indianapolis, Indi.
David Storch
Okay. What's the first item?
Stan Mann - EMS
Yes, kind of more space and activity etcetera. Are there similar bays that you were talking about.
David Storch
They are major contributor to the MRO results for the quarter. We are not at full capacity yet and we're getting good use of the space that we are currently occupying. There is some additional space for us to occupy. We are in discussions with the landlord about trying to figure out how to get more space at that airfield one way or another. So, at this point in time that business is strong. The demand is strong. I believe that some of the short-term capacity opportunities that we might see, that we can't handle there, part of our plan is that some outwork would be done down in Miami. So, Indianapolis is strong. We can tell we are seeing some benefits from some of the sideline activities including engineering services. 
This is an area we highlighted. Stan, you might recall, couple of year back we started to get some traction here this quarter. We hope to build on that key segment of our business as well and sell more of our intellectual property to a customer base who is looking for those kinds of solutions.
Stan Mann - EMS
Is UAL a leasing agent there, I mean are they the owner of the rest of facility.
David Storch
No.
Stan Mann - EMS
So they are not.
David Storch
No. The owner of the facility and do not hold me to this, this is an airport authority. That is basically backed up by the state of Indiana, the city of Indianapolis and there are some bond holders that obviously have positions now in that facility as well. So, we deal with the airport authority and in fact we are looking right now for ways to even take on more space in the Indianapolis.
Stan Mann - EMS
Beyond that facility, in additionâ¦
David Storch
And potentially there is a couple hangars in that facility that we do not control, they are controlled by others.
Stan Mann - EMS
Okay. 
David Storch
The regional airline...
Stan Mann - EMS
Okay. The recent announcement of some of the airlines paring, cutting their capacity domestically, is that whatâs giving you availability of aircraft to buy and you're leasing and purchase agreements? 
David Storch
We haven't seen that yet. We saw that, weâve see kind of steady -- thatâs going to be steady piece of the business let say, if I go back to '03. So we saw some of the benefits back when the airlines were reducing capacity in the '03, '04, '05 time period. So we made some investment in assets during that time period, which we've been able to place elsewhere. In this current, let say, thrust we have not seen serviceable airplanes that hit the market. We have seen airplanes for disassembly that hit the market and we have procured some of those in prior periods.
Stan Mann - EMS
So the opportunities you're seeing are taking it on from the existing leasing companies because we -- AAR is more liquid and stronger than the current leasing agents?
David Storch
I think then that was part of the strategy behind our offering in February was to get us additional liquidity and put us in a stronger position to the benefit from this movement and I think the results are bearing out. Clearly, these markets are not growing at the growth rate that this company is achieving. So, we think we are in a unique position. Our niche continues to expand. We're looking at different opportunities in this regard, and I think having a strong balance sheet obviously position us to take advantage of those opportunities.
But at the same token, we're trying to do thing that don't require balance sheet. I mean the Indianapolis business, we have very small investments in Indianapolis yet, it's a major contributor today to our growth rate both sales and earnings. And I singled earlier about the moving to McClellan Air Force Base and also is a very minimal investment on our part, because we have a strong balance sheet, sometime when you have a strong balance sheet, you don't need to use it to go ahead and get some opportunities. So, I think that's part of our strategy as well.

Stan Mann - EMS
Right, the last question is; do we have anything going on in Asia as far as MRO?
Tim Romenesko
We have a landing gear venture in Malaysia.
Stan Mann - EMS
Right.
Tim Romenesko
That is, just coming into its own more or less not fully online, it's more or less today, more of a store front that eventually will be a full service repair facility. But no other than that stand at this moment, we do not have other physical facilities in that region. We do have sales offices throughout Asia that are managing the relationships with different Asian accounts and, but for the most part we are servicing those customers from our North American facilities.
Stan Mann - EMS
But that could be a stepping stone, a fiscal stepping stone into Asia?
Tim Romenesko
In time, we need to have more Asian content; more Asian mix in our business and it's something we're focused on with the weak the flip side to the weak dollar is the inability to move into some of these markets advantageously. So, for today at least, we're able to get some growth servicing these businesses from North America. But long-term, you're correct the company is going to need more capability in that region.
Stan Mann - EMS
Okay. Good job. Thank you.
Tim Romenesko
Thank you.

Our next question or comment comes from the line of Mr. J.B. Groh. Mr. Groh, your line is open, sir.
J.B. Groh - DA. Davidson & Co.
Good morning. Thanks for taking my call. I popped on late, so if you addressed this just differ and I'll dig it out of the transcript, but you adjusted lease rates a little bit. Could you maybe talk about trends there, do you still see those going up holding firm, you mentioned one renewal that you had that was at a higher rate, but could you maybe make more general comments there on overall lease rates?
David Storch
My sense is that with all of the stuff going on in the world today, that lease rates will probably stay fairly steady to where they are today. Some of the opportunities that we've recently experienced are from aircraft leases, maybe three to five years old and they were rolling over and keep in mind, five year ago lease was in the depths of a kind of aerospace recession or whatever you want call it and lease rates were historically at very low levels.
So, you're seeing some reset in that regard, coming out of that '03, '04 time period, maybe even '05 and as those mature and turnover I should say, the lease rates are more attractive. But I think from this point forward, I believe that the lease rates ones they, ones you're come off the bottom of that period, I just identified. I think the lease rates stay fairly constant.
Now, that's assuming that things stay relatively constant. So, if things where to get worse again, and you'd see a reduction in lease rates. But I think for right now, the aircraft are in short supply worldwide at this point of time, and the more efficient the aircraft is, the more in demand the aircraft is, so we've been focused on more efficient aircraft and making sure that we can keep those aircraft out with good credits and so far we've been pretty successful in that regard.
J.B. Groh - DA. Davidson & Co.
So, what are you saying is old lease rates rolling over you probably get a positive bump up, but as far as current rates are going, you look those to be steady and maybe you've got the fuel headwind that's probably causing those rates to the sort of stay in the same range they're now?
David Storch
I think that pretty much says it.
J.B. Groh - DA. Davidson & Co.
And maybe you can talk about your the market for used aircraft and I'd assume that moves not a lock step, but same sort of trend as maybe the overall commercial production and what your strategy is there, I mean I'm guessing that it's A320 family, 737NG type acquisitions.

David Storch
Yeah, I think we haven't yet moved into the NG arena. We are looking today at opportunities in that market, but yeah, the A320 is something we're trafficking in and most of our activity has been in the 737 Classic family, like for instance the acquisition of 18 aircraft from Malaysian Airline system those were 737-400 that were 1992 to 1997 vintage aircraft. And so if you look at the majority of our portfolio would be in that vintage, yet there is a movement for us at least to move that a little bit more current, if you will.
J.B. Groh - DA. Davidson & Co.
What's the average lease period that you have on the books?
David Storch
The average lease of, the kinds of deals that we're entering are mostly in the three to five year range and we do from time-to-time. We are acquiring, looking at aircraft that have longer lease period, maybe coming off of some of the 20 year, 25, 20 year leases, where we come in after the 50 year or something like that. So, but I'd say generally speaking the lease rates for the aircraft that we are trafficking in are in the 3 to 5 year range.
J.B. Groh - DA. Davidson & Co.
Great, hey thank you for your time and congratulations on the quarter.
David Storch
Thank you.
Operator
Our next question or comment comes from the line of Mr. [David Ratlis from Dulcet Company]. Your line is open, sir. Mr. Ratlis you may need to un-mute your phone, sir. Okay, we will return him to the queue. Our next question or comment is from Mr. Eric Hugel from Stephens. Your line is open sir.
Eric Hugel - Stephens
Good morning guys. Good quarter.
David Storch
Thank you.
Eric Hugel - Stephens
Hey, can you talk about, I know in the past Dave you talked about the Aviation Supply Chain margin sort of typically bouncing around in the 22 to 24 range, for now this is like the second quarter in a row that we've been at the 24 or sort of a high end of that range, is there something sort of structurally that you've changed, you've improved in this business or are we susceptible to sort of those numbers dropping back down?
David Storch
Well, we have a leading position in this market. We've been in this business since our founding. So, we understand the aircraft parts market as well as anybody else in the business. We've been able to benefit from our strong balance sheet position. We talked about back in the second quarter in particular, where we acquired fair amount of inventory and that inventory has starting to flow through our system.
We have meaningful sales coming out of the investments we've made in the second quarter. We continue to make investments in the third quarter and we've even continue to make investments in the fourth quarter in this business.
So, I believe that we've been able to make pretty attractive acquisitions of equipment, and I think you are seeing some of that benefit there in the margin. So how long that sustains itself is a tough question.
We're very pleased with the performance of that group and the 24, you are correct, is the upper end to the margins, yet there are still some elements to that business. Our component repair shops, for instance, there are some opportunities there to improve performance. We recently announced a contract for some Army helicopter component repair that should contribute to improved margins in that business.
But I think on balance, I think you pretty well said it. I think that we can fluctuate between that 22 and 24. We're running at the high end. How long it stays at 24, I can't really say. We haven't seen a change in trends, but it doesn't mean that there can't be circumstance or situations that may cause that to dip down.
Eric Hugel - Stephens
Okay. Fair enough. Can you talk about, I guess, in terms of your overall operating margin number, I mean you are at that now for a second quarter in a row. You've achieved that 10% sort of target that you had set out. You've got Summa now in the mix, and I'm assuming that there was some nice purchase accounting associated with that in this quarter, yet you still maintain that. You got Avborne coming online. I mean, is it your expectation that with some of these headwinds coming out, I guess, additional purchase accounting that you'd be able to maintain that 10% operating margin going forward?

David Storch
Yeah. Listen, as we make these acquisitions, they've been a little bit of a drag on the margins. So, as we try to normalize the business, my opening comments that the sales growth was 39% if you back out the acquisition. So if you just looked organically, sales growth was 25%, and then if you back out the year-over-year aircraft transactions, sales growth was 19%. We reported 10.1% operating margin, but if you backed out the acquisitions and you backed out the aircraft transactions, operating margins would have been 10.4%.
So, the acquisitions we've made have been a little bit of a drag on operating margins for some of the some reasons that you identified. And over time, as we integrate these businesses, it would be our goal to see the operating, these be contributors to our operating margin business. It might be a little tougher for the Avborne business because, by nature, the MRO business has tougher operating margins. But also keep in mind, there is less investments in those business. So, return on capital has been a better measurement for the MRO businesses.
Nevertheless, we would expect Tim has numerous initiatives going on around the company. We have lean initiatives in our Indianapolis business, in our landing gear business, in our components shops in New York, and hopefully, eventually in Amsterdam. So, we were looking for ways to drive efficiency through the company.
Going back to the performance, goals of the company, we recognize that the growth that we're getting today is largely, we believe, due to taking market share and we're taking that market share because we're performing. We're performing for the customer, but we also recognize, we need to perform for the shareholder. So, in that process we hope to continue down that path of getting to that 12.5% target.
It will be, it goes in is and goes out is, and as we absorb these acquisitions at first blush they are a drag, and then, hopefully, we're able to execute and get these margins going in the right direction.
Eric Hugel - Stephens
With regards to Summa, was there a significant amount of inventory step up that hit you this quarter that would pretty much washout during this quarter and you wouldn't have that headwind going forward?
David Storch
No, Eric, nothing that is isolated on a quarter.
Eric Hugel - Stephens
Okay. With regards to Southwest, I guess in the mix of all of these sort of maintenance troubles that they are sort of going through, one of the interesting things that they sort of announced was that they were planning on moving four lines of maintenance to El Salvador, which now they've shelved those plans, and they said all those lines were outsourced in the US to providers.
One, were any of those sort of planned lines of maintenance, anything that you guys are doing with them at Indy?
And two, are there potential discussion or is there an opportunity that you potentially see now that they are killing those plans to outsource those lines to El Salvador they're going to keep them domestic to get some more additional business there?
Tim Romenesko
So, Eric, the lines that were going to go were not coming out of Indy. Southwest is good customer and we're working with them everyway we can to support them. We've helped them get some of their aircraft back to service, and we're constantly talking to them about ways to be more helpful.
Eric Hugel - Stephens
The Southwest issues in terms of their maintenance lapses and check, that's all internal to Southwest. That does noting do with third party MRO providers, does it?
Tim Romenesko
Correct.
Eric Hugel - Stephens
Okay.
Tim Romenesko
As David mentioned, it's largely around the paperwork.
Eric Hugel - Stephens
Okay. Also, United, they are a sizeable customer at Indy. They're talking about taking 15 to 20 aircraft out of the mix. They're talking about older domestic aircraft, which to me means their 737s, 300s and 500s, their oldest aircraft in the fleet domestic and you are the exclusive provider of all that maintenance. Are there plans right now, are you in discussions about reducing the number of lines, and then you would have to fill in some additional lines? I know they are flying about 95 37's right now. So reducing 15 to 20 is not the end of world, but is there a potential here that as we get into the back half of the year that you're going to see a line reduction?

Tim Romenesko
There is always a potential. But right now that's not the nature of the conversations we're having with United. So we're prepared for that if that were to happen, but that's not what we're hearing.
Eric Hugel - Stephens
Okay. Tim, can give us an update on where things stand with the component repair business and getting those margins up? I mean we've been, I guess, slower than hoped for, for the last couple of quarters on the trek up from breakeven up to high single digit operating margins. Can you give us sort of a trend of where things are and how much far that we have to go?
Rick Poulton
David has touched on it in his comments. We've got a good start in that. We've won some business recently, some meaningful business. And I think you probably saw that release. We've strengthened the leadership of that business recently that we think is also going to have an impact. We're investing in some process improvement initiative there.
So, as David said, I think there is still plenty of upside there but we are starting at the early stages of seeing some improvement.
Eric Hugel - Stephens
Would you say that right now, that sort of business in terms of operating margin is mid single-digit?
Rick Poulton
Yes.
Eric Hugel - Stephens
Okay, great. And then the lastly, just sort of a numbers question, give CapEx for the quarter?
Rick Poulton
Eric, I say mid single-digit or about.
Eric Hugel - Stephens
Okay.
Rick Poulton
CapEx Eric is just under $80 million for the quarter.
Eric Hugel - Stephens
Great. Thanks a lot guys, good quarter.
Rick Poulton
Thanks.

(Operator Instruction) We have a follow-up from Troy Lahr from Stifel. Your line is open, sir.
Troy Lahr - Stifel
Thanks. Just a follow-up question on Indi, you guys talked a lot about still seeing good customer interest there looking to expand the facility. How is the labor market been there? Have you seen improvements there?
David Storch
I'd say modest improvements, but still I'd say relatively tight.
Troy Lahr - Stifel
Okay. So are wage rates still pretty higher now or have you seen wage rates come down a little bit?
David Storch
Well, that's so much around the wages I wouldn't say, wages have not come down. I think it's an industry-wide maybe even beyond industry-wide problem getting attracting skilled technical labor.
Troy Lahr - Stifel
Okay.
David Storch
Certainly not unique to Indianapolis.
Troy Lahr - Stifel
Sure. Okay. And then regarding SUMMA Technology, the integration, are you fully done with the integration or can you just maybe update us on that? Did you see any surprises, once you actually acquired the business, kind of maybe what you experienced with Rev Air bear how it cost you a little more to integrate some of that, anything going on like that in SUMMA?
David Storch
I think the integration has gone quite well. There has been some real solid positive that we have seen and really not any significant negatives.
Tim Romenesko
Troy, I would just add to that as David said, it's a additional leg on the stool, so the level of integration I think it's fair to say was a lot lower than it would been at Hot Springs acquisition.
Troy Lahr - Stifel
Okay. And then lastly at the MRO business, I guess couple of quarters ago, you had some problem aircraft contracts comes through, some problem aircraft. Any more of that do you think that's a kind of behind you and kind of understand what have been and you are on the same page with the customer now about what aircraft coming through your facilities?
Tim Romenesko
Yes.
Troy Lahr - Stifel
Can you elaborate or just--?
Tim Romenesko
No, I mean those issues are well behind us. I think they were a point in time a couple quarters ago and we are not experiencing those difficulties with those airplanes.
Troy Lahr - Stifel
Okay. Are you reworking any additional MRO contracts trying to get better pricing on any of those? I think you went though that in the past on one contract, just wondered is that ongoing?

Tim Romenesko
There is no specific contract kind of contract renegotiation going on. As we look at Avborne and bring on new customers, but I don't think is there anything going on right now in terms of renegotiating the contracts.
Troy Lahr - Stifel
Okay, thanks guys.

Our next question or comment is a follow-up from Mr. Tyler Hojo. Your line is open sir.
Tyler Hojo - Sidoti & Company
Two quick follow-up. Just in regards to the Indianapolis facility, how many bays are you currently utilizing?
David Storch
Tyler, it changes fairly frequently, but I think at last count we were booking out of eight bays. And we're getting ready to bring the paint bay on as well.
Tyler Hojo - Sidoti & Company
Okay. Great. And lastly, just in terms to your aircraft portfolio, I believe the last time you commented just in terms of the number of aircraft purchase pre-9/11 was the first quarter when there were six. How many are on the books as of today?
David Storch
Three. I didn't hear -- the question is on the pre-9/11 aircrafts on the books, three.
Tyler Hojo - Sidoti & Company
Three? Okay, great. Thanks.

Our next question or comment comes from Arnie Ursaner from CJS Securities. Your line is open.
Arnie Ursaner - CJS Securities
Hi, good morning. Two very quick questions. One is on the cash that you have on your balance sheet, can you give us a feel for if you have any exposure auction rate notes and what sort of rates you're getting on the cash.
Tim Romenesko
No auction rate notes.
David Storch
No exposure, Arnie, and what earnings on that cash, you know, somewhere between 300 and 375 bips.
Arnie Ursaner - CJS Securities
Okay. And just to be clear, on Southwest did you receive any emergency repair work on this recent announcement, and if so, did it displace other work that you already had in hand?
David Storch
Arnie, we helped Southwest in some of their outstations doing remote overnight inspections, so it didn't displace anything.
Arnie Ursaner - CJS Securities
But if you did work in their sites, you had to obviously take some of your key personnel to their site to do it?
David Storch
It was not disruptive to our operations in any way.
Arnie Ursaner - CJS Securities
Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator
Our final question will be from Mr. Larry Solow. Mr. Solow, your line is open.
Larry Solow - CJS Securities
Just one real quickie, any update on the Airbus A400 contract and is there any potential to see revenues in calendar 2008?
David Storch
It looks like it's going to be early '09, Larry, when deliveries begin. We're continuing to work with our prime contractor and with Airbus to get the cargo system design finalized and the manufacturing ramped up. So it looks like it's going to be early '09 when it starts to impact revenue throughout.

Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for joining this morning's conference call.Before we begin, we would like to remind you that certain of the comments made today relate to future events, which are forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Please refer to the forward-looking statement disclaimer contained in the press release issued last evening, as well as those factors discussed under Item 1A entitled ""Risk Factors"" included in the company's May 31st, 2007 Form 10-K. By providing forward-looking statements, the company assumes no obligation to update the forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statements or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events.At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, David Storch.David StorchThank you, John, and good morning to everyone. Joining me today is Tim Romenesko, our President and Chief Operating Officer, and Rick Poulton, our Chief Financial Officer.Let me begin by saying that we had an exceptional quarter by virtually any measurement or dimension, where we experienced record quarterly sales, net income and earnings per share. Sales grew 39% to $376.6 million and income from continuing operations grew 31% to $20.3 million. Diluted earnings per share were $0.47 for the quarter, which included $0.01 loss per share on the early extinguishment of debt. While acquisitions contributed meaningfully to the results for the quarter, organic sales, which excludes sales growth from acquisitions, grew an impressive 25% year-over-year.If you were to further back out the aircraft sales from both periods our growth rate would have been 19%. We achieved 10.1% operating margins and if you were to back out the effects of the acquisitions and the aircraft sales, margins on our organic business would have been 10.4%.Sales were $151.2 million in the Aviation Supply Chain segment, an increase of 11.5% from last year, and gross margin improved 200 basis points to 24%. Gross profit increased 22% to $36.3 million. During this period, we generated sales from investments made in prior periods, which contributed to double-digit sales increase. Sales of our MRO segment grew 43% in the quarter to $74.8 million. Gross profit increased 53% to $11.1 million, resulting in a gross profit margin of 14.9%. Steady performance at our Indianapolis maintenance center and Landing Gear businesses, resulted in market share gains which drove the exceptional sales and earnings growth in this segment.At the conclusion of the quarter, or I should say at the beginning of the new quarter, the fourth quarter, we completed the acquisition of Avborne, which will add a valuable dimension to our MRO position. The business is located at Miami International Airport, a very busy airport, with a high traffic pattern and access to international routes, and rounds out our MRO services by adding wide-body and Airbus capabilities.We look forward to the opportunities this business brings and along these lines just last week, there was an aircraft at MIA that required a return-to-service maintenance, the aircraft was brought over to our facility. And this maintenance required landing gear repair, folks from our Landing Gear operation, about 10 miles away from MIA airport, came over to the airport and provided the repair on the landing gear, while our aircraft maintenance folks worked on the repair to the aircraft. And we're successful putting that aircraft back up into the sky same day. The customer, who is not a current customer of our heavy maintenance operations, was very pleased with the service we performed, and next week our folks would be meeting with this customer to talk about how we can capture more of their maintenance.In the Structures and Systems segment, our organic sales growth rate was 17% fueled by strength in our mobility systems business and the overall sales growth rate in the segment was 75% after the impact of the Brown International and SUMMA acquisitions are included. Gross profit grew 84% to $16.4 million resulting in a gross profit margin of 14.8%.During the quarter, we announced that we signed a lease to occupy 90,000 square feet in McClellan Business Park, formerly McClellan Air Force Base, in Sacramento, California for the manufacture of composite structures and parts and this is an area, where we are seeing increasing demand. We expect the business to come on line during the first quarter of our fiscal 2009.Just to clarify, McClellan Air Force Base was closed as a result of the BRAC Base Realignment Act of 1994, and we have another operation at that air field. They became aware of this opportunity, and we were able to sieze upon it in this quarter. We will have a minimal investment and we expect that to have a very dynamic business out of that facility.Our Aircraft Sales and Leasing segment delivered another strong quarter. As a reminder, results for our Aircraft Sales and Leasing business are reported two ways; first we purchase and sell aircraft for own account results of which flow through our income statement as sales and cost of sales. Second, we enter into aircraft transactions with partners, which are characterized as unconsolidated joint ventures and are reported within the earnings from aircraft joint ventures line our income statement.During the third quarter, operating profit for the segment increased $3.1 million compared to year ago, even though you do see a reduction income on the face of P&L from aircraft joint ventures. The increase in operating profit of the segments reflects a gain from the sale of two of our aircraft from our own account. As of February 29th, we had a total of 37 aircraft, 29 of which are held in joint ventures and 8 of which are held in AARs fully owned portfolio.Furthermore, I would like to comment that as a result of the financial market turmoil, we do expect more opportunities to emerge in this market. SG&A cost for the company increased in the quarter, as a result of the acquisitions and as we continued to invest in our business. However, as a percentage of sales SG&A cost declined to 9% versus 9.1% in the prior year.Net interest expense increased to $6.1 million in the third quarter due to increased average borrowings and lower investment income. In February the company issued 250 million of convertible notes through a private placement. Proceeds after acquiring these associated note hedge and transaction fees were $215 million and were used in parts payoff the outstanding balance and our revolving credit facility, which slightly, largely related to the acquisition of SUMMA and the investments we have made in parts for our Aviation Supply Chain business.In addition during the third quarter the remaining balance of the 2004 convertible notes of $16.4 million were converted to 880,000 shares of our common stock. These shares were already included in our share count. Subsequently, at the end of the third quarter we bought back 13 million of our 8.39% notes due in 2011. As a result of these actions, we expect interest expense to decline in the fourth quarter.In closing I might say that we achieved double-digit sales growth in each of our segments, added a significant dimension to our Structures and Systems business mix, and strengthened our liquidity with recent financing. As we assess risk and seek opportunities like the rest of you, we're paying very close attention to capital market volatility, the economic environment in the United States and abroad, and rising oil prices and their impact on our industry and customer base.With that, I'd like to thank you for participating on the call today, and open up the line for any questions you may have.Question-and-Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions)Our first question or comment comes from the line of Troy Lahr. Mr. Lahr, your line is open.Troy Lahr - Stifel Nicolaus & CompanyThanks. Structures and Systems had good margins. I guess you're seeing the favorable mix there towards containers. How much longer does that continue forward? Does that run forward next three quarters, four quarters, just give me some insight there?David StorchYes. The mobility business has a very strong backlog. The mix is favorable. We're continuing to see opportunities for new business for new products. So, we feel good about the prospects. They're both from volume and mix for a while. Whether it's three quarters or nine quarters, I don't know, but the backlog is good for at least another year.Troy Lahr - Stifel Nicolaus & CompanyOkay. Thanks. And then, just that I'm clear you talked a little bit about outsourcing opportunities. We've been kind of waiting for some time to hear other Mesa or Chautauqua size transactions. Is the activity there increasing now that we're kind of getting into a tightening environment, the ongoing negotiation that you've had of this kind of an accelerated with some airlines or just can you update us there a little bit?David StorchI would say that there is a good amount of activity, some large, some medium and some small. And they run the gamut from the various customers we support. So, at this point, I think that the activity level --Troy Lahr - Stifel Nicolaus & CompanyHas it been kind of accelerating or just kind of been about the same?David StorchI'd say it's about the same. I think there are several opportunities that we're working on out there.Troy Lahr - Stifel Nicolaus & CompanyOkay. And then, just lastly, and then I'll jump back in the queue, can you maybe talk about the composite business that you acquired, how quickly do you think that ramps up, and maybe what markets are you targeting? I mean is this more commercial aerospace or defense type applications for composite work?Tim RomeneskoIt's not a business we acquired. It's a facility that was fully equipped by the US Air Force back in the '90s for composite manufacturing. So, we are a ""let's see if you will"" of a facility. It's a long-term lease. And as the lease progresses, the equipment inside the facility becomes the property of the company. The opportunities are in the commercial aerospace space, defense, as well as the business jet and general aviation segment. So, it's pretty much across the board.We have, as you know, a composite business already in existence located in Clearwater, Florida. It's been very busy. It's somewhat limited by the number of autoclaves. In this particular lease, we pick up four additional autoclaves, two of which incidentally have never been turned on. So, the reason that we expect to ramp-up in our first quarter, which is beginning in June let's say, is because the facility needs to be reenergized, then reopen basically.So, we see a fair amount of demand, or I should say excessive demand in this area. We have the talent we believe in-house. We've actually hired some additional folks to go ahead and build this into a very productive segment within AAR. To a certain extent, I think one way of looking at this business is very similar to how you might look at Indianapolis for MRO business. I think it's an opportunistic move by the company in an area that appears to be chockfull of demand.Troy Lahr - Stifel Nicolaus & CompanyOkay. Just so I'm clear then, I mean is some of the Clearwater work getting offloaded to this facility or all that work is going to stay at Clearwater?Tim RomeneskoNo, the work that's in Clearwater will stay in Clearwater, and this will be new work that we will attempt to attract. Now we might get that plan started by shifting some work elsewhere from AAR into the facility, at least, gets off and running. But once we get over the early stages, we do expect to attract new business.Troy Lahr - Stifel Nicolaus & CompanyGreat. Thanks, guys.OperatorOur next question or comment comes from the line of Larry Solow from CJS. Your line is open, sir.Larry Solow - CJSGood morning. Could you just maybe talk a little bit about the impact you're seeing around the major airlines cutting in domestic capacity? Recently Delta have made announcement yesterday. Would this capacity be switched to the international front or how's that going to play, how you think that will play out?David StorchIf you take a look at the growth that we've experienced in our Aircraft Sales and Leasing segment, a lot of that growth has come from our ability to acquire aircraft in the US market, and then place those aircraft into international markets. Demand for air travel does not appear to be easing at this point in time.As I indicated in my comments, we are obviously watching this to see what the effects of the US economy might have on domestic travel. So some of the older technology aircraft may be parked, but we do believe that if newer technology aircraft get parked they will be placed elsewhere. We view that as an opportunity both for our aircraft sales and leasing segment, as well as for our supply chain, and pass it our for MRO to put those aircraft back into service with another operator.So, although we believe that you might have some comedown here in North America, we don't believe that worldwide travel or traffic numbers are declining.Larry Solow - CJSOkay. Now then a similar question just looking on the international front, would you say that -- I know we have discussed this before a lot, but with the continuing of the weakening dollar would you expect maybe more opportunities for international airliners to actually be bringing their planes in to North America for work?David StorchWe have received some increase along those lines. We've yet to secure any business on the heavy maintenance side. We're hoping that having this Miami business will facilitate that opportunity and but time will tell. At this point in time the exchange rate obviously is favorable on this regard and it might lead to certain opportunities for the company. I would expect this, incidentally more obviously wide bodies than narrow bodies. Narrow bodies donât have go across the ponds, but we might see some opportunities along these lines.We clearly are seeing some benefits on other businesses from the exchange rate and we are working diligently on the structures and systems business in that regard. Keep in mind, all of our manufacturing capabilities is in North America, so we do see that as a potential opportunity for the company.Larry Solow - CJSGreat, and if you could just lastly just discuss a little bit, I believe the SUMMA acquisition if I am not mistaken was like a $100 million annualized revenue. If you could just discuss that and then the Avborne acquisition and how Avborne maybe compares to Indianapolis and I know it is small to say, but I believe the capacity is probably not as small it looks on numbers basis. So if we can just kind of compare with the annualized or potential revenues for those two acquisitions. That will be great.David StorchSUMMA is a very exciting acquisition for the company and that puts another leg on our stool within our Structures and Systems group. Our Structures and Systems group even today consist primarily of the mobility activity, as well as specific manufacturing of products for cargo systems and then we have a composite leg and the SUMMA gives us what we believe is the foundation for an aircraft parts manufacturing piece of our Structures and Systems group. So you are correct in terms of the annualized revenue base.We are hoping to be able to build from that. SUMMA has very good relations, very time-tested relationships with major OEs in the aircraft manufacturing business and we are hoping to capitalize on those and be able to hopefully as result of this move in to McClellan. McClellan will be able to benefit from some of the deep ties SUMMA has with maybe this OEs. So the SUMMA acquisition if you are correct in terms of the size, but I just to want to highlight the fact that it does bring us the potential, that we did not previously have within our Structures and Systems business. So SUMMA is not a bolt-on. SUMMA is kind of adding a leg to our stool.As it relates to Avborne, Avborne is similar in terms of basic fundamental capability within the Indianapolis, other than SUMMA has, I mean Avborne had some success on Airbus airplanes and also wide-body aircraft, the hangars are built in such a way that they can accommodate wide-body aircraft and also Avborne gives us a location that we believe is a very important location as we round out our MRO capability here in North America. So, Avborne is more of a bolt-on than Summa might be, yet Avborne does bring us certain dimensions that we didnât previously have.Larry Solow - CJSOkay. Great, thank you.OperatorOur next question or comment comes from the line of Mr. Tyler Hojo from Sidoti. Your line is open.Tyler Hojo - SidotiGood morning, guys. I guess this is just a follow-up to that Avborne question. I guess Rick, last conference call you provided kind of an annualized revenue figure for Summa. Would you guys be willing to do that for Avborne?Rick PoultonI think the number there is a little more challenging Tyler because of whether we decide to work narrow-bodies, wide-bodies, etcetera. So, I think weâll hold back from providing that number now. I think the best thing you could do is you can interpolate a little bit on the square footage base. I think, you also know, what our acquisition prices, and can sort of hone in as a multiple of revenue from that. As we get maybe a firmer mix on where we will with the workload then maybe we will better positioned to give you some better guidance.Tyler Hojo - SidotiThatâs fair. And know you provided the square footage for Avborne. What is the current capacity utilization in that facility?Tim RomeneskoTyler, Avborne is busy, there are kind of lot of airplanes coming in out of there. But it is not a nose-to-tail shop like your custom to see in it Indianapolis. So, one of things that we expect to bring in there is maybe not all in place, but we should allocate more of the capacities in nose-to-tail.So, it's very busy, when I was there last week I actually have 15 aircraft around the facility, but some are in there for overnight checks, some are in for two days check, some are in there for 60 days. So, it's little difficult to characterize at the same way you might characterize Indy.Tyler Hojo - SidotiOkay. Thanks for the color, Tim. And just in terms of that kind of your longstanding, longer-term margin target that has been out there 12.5%. I didn't hear you guys kind of reconfirm it. Is that still intact?Tim RomeneskoYes.Tyler Hojo - SidotiOkay, great.Tim RomeneskoYeah, as we make some of these acquisitions, there is, some of these acquisitions have margins below even the 10% that we're looking at and so we have some challenges. Yeah, we view there are many opportunities to go ahead and get margin improvement.Tyler Hojo - SidotiOkay, good. And just a final one, a follow-up to the first questionnaire, just in terms of the supply chain opportunities out there, I think last conference call David you mentioned that your thought something relatively meaningful could hit kind of in the back half for your fiscal year. You still stick in to that or as it maybe pushed a little bit further out to the right or any comments that would be helpful.David StorchOf course, half of that first, second half of the year has gone away. We didn't make any announcement.Tyler Hojo - SidotiAlright.David StorchSo, obviously we're now in the last three months. There is a possibility of at least one of these hitting this quarter, but I'd push out some of the balance just based on the -- the overall gestation period I'd push out the balance in to next year, but if I have to say, as you recall last quarter's supply chain we had sales growth of less than 10% there was 8 in change I believe. This quarter we say we will come in above -- against the double-digits we came at 11.5. There is no shortage of opportunities in that business segment and some of them are program related, some are look like programs, but we're not calling them programs, let's put it this way the pace of business is very brisk.Tyler Hojo - SidotiThat's fine and actually just one more for you. It look like the MRO segment, the results were terrific there. Actually, one of your competitors came out late last week and they blamed some bad weather in Oklahoma for kind of a revenue miss in their Tulsa facility. Was there any kind of negative impact in the number?Rick PoultonOh, we definitely saw the bad weather.Tyler Hojo - SidotiOkay.Rick PoultonBut no significant impact in our operations.David StorchWe didn't have the magnitude that they seem to have had.Tyler Hojo - SidotiVery, good. Thanks.David StorchLet me just reiterate, what you said incidentally that is the growth rate within our MRO segment was truly exceptional 43% growth rate that's all organic I believe it's around as we've talked about before, it's around execution, our MRO team is executing I think beautifully and customers are very satisfied with the work load and looking for AAR to take on more work if we can and I really would like to just congratulate Tim and his team in this regard, because they're doing heck of a job, it's not -- like this business is just hanging up there for somebody to grab and this is you're talking about 43% growth rate in a market that is relatively flat. And my sense is that this is all about our team performing and getting that kind of a growth rate.Tyler Hojo - SidotiGreat, thanks.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Jon Braatz. Mr. Braatz, your line is open.Jon Braatz - Kansas City CapitalLast couple of weeks, we've been hearing some stories in the press about MRO work at Southwest or issues with maintenance operations at Southwest and there is stories in Asia about Asian MRO work. How do you view that? Is that a positive maybe from a long-term standpoint, is the FAA gets a little bit tougher or are there some other issues that might develop that in more paperwork or more work for you guys. But, how do you view all this talk about MRO, I mean, the maintenance work on aircraft both domestically and internationally?David StorchYeah, the MRO business is a very detailed oriented business, obviously you're talking about safety of flight and we at ARR understand that. We've been in the MRO business through our Oklahoma operation for many years. We are very focus around the detail of the work that we do, having the paperwork, having the training in place as you recall, each of our technicians receives training, pretty much every year, the last three or four years, we've received the Diamond Award from the FAA for having every technician at AAR goes to training. Now, it's a very complex putting the aircraft through a maintenance cycle is a very complex process.In the case of Southwest, managing a fleet as wide as they are is very complex. And I think everybody has pretty much reiterated its safety record as the worldâs airlines is truly remarkable. There is a chain, if you will a safety chain. They are the major part of and this is an area that we stay very focused on and pay a lot of attention to the details, and the procedures, and the processes, and the paper work and all that kind of stuff. So, I think if you look at the world that weâre in is a kind of flight-to-quality, then I think quality providers will be in a very good position to benefit. Back here there are some folks who are not necessarily as adept or as detail-oriented as this business requires.So, I feel very good, our head is down if you will, and weâre making certain that we have, we're doing all the things we're supposed to do and we're paying a lot of attention to this segment and it's really no different than we always have. I mean, this is as I said; itâs a very detail-oriented business and you got to pay attention to a lot of different things. And they are from time-to-time, they are slips and the important thing is that the organization has processes in place to capture these slips before they become a problem. So, I believe overall that in the general flight-to-quality lets say, as long as we continue to execute the way we are, we should be a beneficiary.Jon Braatz - Kansas City CapitalDoes the FAA have any, I guess mandate or a power to suggest, that airlines move from one provider to another or is it or kind of the sort of the mandatory type of call on the part of the FAA. So, this MRO provider is not meeting standards, you have to move.David StorchI believe that's within the power of FAA. The FAA has oversight and all of the licensed facilities that carry FAA designation. So they have the ability to monitor on a minutes notice. They have the ability to send staff and teams into facilities that have a certificate. They have the ability to go through their procedures to make sure they are operating within the regulations and if they deem them not to be operating within the regulations, they have the ability to pull their ticket.Jon Braatz - Kansas City CapitalOkay.David StorchFrom time-to-time over the years, they have exercised that privilege.Jon Braatz - Kansas City CapitalRight, okay.David StorchI think in terms of them officially recommending a vendor, one vendor versus another to their customers probably not in their purview. But I mean, you obviously listen when two guys are having a discussion. It probably might not be uncommon for somebody to give an opinion to somebody else and that can always happen.Jon Braatz - Kansas City CapitalOkay, thank you very much.David StorchOkay.OperatorOur next question or comment comes from the line of Alex Hamilton from Jesup & Lamont. Your line is open sir.Alex Hamilton - Jesup & LamontHi, good morning. Just, can you provide some sort of color on the sales and leasing market given the liquidity and credit concern? Has there been any change to liquidity, has there been any change to financing rate? That would be appreciated?David StorchWell, that's a complicated question. Let me try to answer this succinctly as I can. Clearly there is obviously at least US, maybe it is international liquidity crunch, which we are very well aware of. We are currently our fleet is fully leased. We have recently actually renegotiated a couple of leases in our favor, where the leases have rolled over and the new rate is at a higher number than the old rate.In terms of the sales of assets in the quarter that we concluded, February 29, we were successful in selling two of our existing aircraft on a cash basis to the buyers who either had the money or financed it. And on the side of availability and I think what we are trying to signal in today's conference call, my comments was that we believe that the liquidity pressures on some of the players will create a certain amount of opportunity. And we are paying very close attention and talking with those who have been publicized to have liquidity problems on owned aircraft and those who might not be publicized but may in fact have liquidity concerns.So we are fairly optimistic in this regard that as a result of some of the liquidity pressure that there will be aircraft opportunities for our aircraft sales and leasing business. Now we are raising our hurdle rate to take into consideration the overall risk environment. So we would anticipate kind of looking out for positive, maybe the option, the last choice let say, because we have to pay very close attention to the acquisition prices that we pay for these assets, keeping in mind our view at least of the risk profile of this market. So all of that -- what I am trying to say in this fashion, as I can say is that we are aware that there are owners of aircraft who have liquidity concerns, problems I should say and we believe we're in a good position to benefit from that.Alex Hamilton - Jesup & LamontGreat. Thank you.OperatorOur next question or comment comes from the line of [Stan Mann from EMS]. Your line is open, sir.Stan Mann - EMSFirst, congratulations on a great quarter. I mean it is fantastic.David StorchThank you.Stan Mann - EMSI have some couple of detailed questions financial. Can you give us the D&A, the regular D&A going forward and the acquisition D&A going forward. I have a couple of questions I am trying to model?Rick PoultonSo D&As for the quarter was $10.4 million which brings you to our year-to-date, right at $30 million, just slightly shy of $30 million.Stan Mann - EMSOkay.Rick PoultonThat reflects a full quarter of all the acquisitions we made, other than Avborne, which obviously just closed at the beginning of this quarter. So I think that rate for Q3 is a pretty good run rate, you have got adjust for current CapEx and then later on something for Avborne. I don't have that Avborne right now, but it tends to be the more labor intensive and capital intensive business, so it is...Stan Mann - EMSSo it is not major. $1 million or $2 million in the quarter or something like that?Rick PoultonYeah, the only caveat to that is we do have purchasing accounting to apply to the acquisition that will create some amortization. That wouldnât otherwise have been in a P&L. So I don't have that number handy. But I mean you could do based on a purchase price and some general allocations you could probably estimate that probably of course easily.Stan Mann - EMSOkay, what about the net debt and the diluted shares going forward?Rick PoultonDiluted shares is something that what you see right now in the current quarter; should not change dramatically. You have a little bit of ups and downs for either stock repurchases on our part or some option exercises or things like that. But thatâs pretty minor. It wouldnât be until we got to a much higher stock price than we're now, that you would see any dilutive effects from the recent convert we get.Stan Mann - EMSIs that 35, is that a 35 area orâ¦?Rick PoultonLittle over 35, correct.Stan Mann - EMSAnd the dilution at that point would beâ¦?Rick PoultonIt comes in under a treasury stock method of accounting. So, itâs a function of what the actual stock price is at that time.Stan Mann - EMSOkay.Rick PoultonSo, you shouldnât see any real share change until you get into the $35 plus stock zone and it begins to come in slowly. On the net debt, you see from the press release, what our recourse debt looks like at this juncture. As David mentioned earlier, we did contract to, we entered into a repurchase agreement to buyback some money, some amount of our secured notes. And beyond that itâs a function of what we do with our cash and how we invest in our business. So, I think I am more comfortable telling you that gross debt, you can see that. And then we have a fair amount of cash on hand at the end of the quarter and will deploy that as we see business opportunities.Stan Mann - EMSOkay. Storch does it look like in India as far as buying or utilizing more space?David StorchDo you saying India.Stan Mann - EMSIndianapolis, Indi.David StorchOkay. What's the first item?Stan Mann - EMSYes, kind of more space and activity etcetera. Are there similar bays that you were talking about.David StorchThey are major contributor to the MRO results for the quarter. We are not at full capacity yet and we're getting good use of the space that we are currently occupying. There is some additional space for us to occupy. We are in discussions with the landlord about trying to figure out how to get more space at that airfield one way or another. So, at this point in time that business is strong. The demand is strong. I believe that some of the short-term capacity opportunities that we might see, that we can't handle there, part of our plan is that some outwork would be done down in Miami. So, Indianapolis is strong. We can tell we are seeing some benefits from some of the sideline activities including engineering services. This is an area we highlighted. Stan, you might recall, couple of year back we started to get some traction here this quarter. We hope to build on that key segment of our business as well and sell more of our intellectual property to a customer base who is looking for those kinds of solutions.Stan Mann - EMSIs UAL a leasing agent there, I mean are they the owner of the rest of facility.David StorchNo.Stan Mann - EMSSo they are not.David StorchNo. The owner of the facility and do not hold me to this, this is an airport authority. That is basically backed up by the state of Indiana, the city of Indianapolis and there are some bond holders that obviously have positions now in that facility as well. So, we deal with the airport authority and in fact we are looking right now for ways to even take on more space in the Indianapolis.Stan Mann - EMSBeyond that facility, in additionâ¦David StorchAnd potentially there is a couple hangars in that facility that we do not control, they are controlled by others.Stan Mann - EMSOkay. David StorchThe regional airline...Stan Mann - EMSOkay. The recent announcement of some of the airlines paring, cutting their capacity domestically, is that whatâs giving you availability of aircraft to buy and you're leasing and purchase agreements? David StorchWe haven't seen that yet. We saw that, weâve see kind of steady -- thatâs going to be steady piece of the business let say, if I go back to '03. So we saw some of the benefits back when the airlines were reducing capacity in the '03, '04, '05 time period. So we made some investment in assets during that time period, which we've been able to place elsewhere. In this current, let say, thrust we have not seen serviceable airplanes that hit the market. We have seen airplanes for disassembly that hit the market and we have procured some of those in prior periods.Stan Mann - EMSSo the opportunities you're seeing are taking it on from the existing leasing companies because we -- AAR is more liquid and stronger than the current leasing agents?David StorchI think then that was part of the strategy behind our offering in February was to get us additional liquidity and put us in a stronger position to the benefit from this movement and I think the results are bearing out. Clearly, these markets are not growing at the growth rate that this company is achieving. So, we think we are in a unique position. Our niche continues to expand. We're looking at different opportunities in this regard, and I think having a strong balance sheet obviously position us to take advantage of those opportunities.But at the same token, we're trying to do thing that don't require balance sheet. I mean the Indianapolis business, we have very small investments in Indianapolis yet, it's a major contributor today to our growth rate both sales and earnings. And I singled earlier about the moving to McClellan Air Force Base and also is a very minimal investment on our part, because we have a strong balance sheet, sometime when you have a strong balance sheet, you don't need to use it to go ahead and get some opportunities. So, I think that's part of our strategy as well.Stan Mann - EMSRight, the last question is; do we have anything going on in Asia as far as MRO?Tim RomeneskoWe have a landing gear venture in Malaysia.Stan Mann - EMSRight.Tim RomeneskoThat is, just coming into its own more or less not fully online, it's more or less today, more of a store front that eventually will be a full service repair facility. But no other than that stand at this moment, we do not have other physical facilities in that region. We do have sales offices throughout Asia that are managing the relationships with different Asian accounts and, but for the most part we are servicing those customers from our North American facilities.Stan Mann - EMSBut that could be a stepping stone, a fiscal stepping stone into Asia?Tim RomeneskoIn time, we need to have more Asian content; more Asian mix in our business and it's something we're focused on with the weak the flip side to the weak dollar is the inability to move into some of these markets advantageously. So, for today at least, we're able to get some growth servicing these businesses from North America. But long-term, you're correct the company is going to need more capability in that region.Stan Mann - EMSOkay. Good job. Thank you.Tim RomeneskoThank you.OperatorOur next question or comment comes from the line of Mr. J.B. Groh. Mr. Groh, your line is open, sir.J.B. Groh - DA. Davidson & Co.Good morning. Thanks for taking my call. I popped on late, so if you addressed this just differ and I'll dig it out of the transcript, but you adjusted lease rates a little bit. Could you maybe talk about trends there, do you still see those going up holding firm, you mentioned one renewal that you had that was at a higher rate, but could you maybe make more general comments there on overall lease rates?David StorchMy sense is that with all of the stuff going on in the world today, that lease rates will probably stay fairly steady to where they are today. Some of the opportunities that we've recently experienced are from aircraft leases, maybe three to five years old and they were rolling over and keep in mind, five year ago lease was in the depths of a kind of aerospace recession or whatever you want call it and lease rates were historically at very low levels.So, you're seeing some reset in that regard, coming out of that '03, '04 time period, maybe even '05 and as those mature and turnover I should say, the lease rates are more attractive. But I think from this point forward, I believe that the lease rates ones they, ones you're come off the bottom of that period, I just identified. I think the lease rates stay fairly constant.Now, that's assuming that things stay relatively constant. So, if things where to get worse again, and you'd see a reduction in lease rates. But I think for right now, the aircraft are in short supply worldwide at this point of time, and the more efficient the aircraft is, the more in demand the aircraft is, so we've been focused on more efficient aircraft and making sure that we can keep those aircraft out with good credits and so far we've been pretty successful in that regard.J.B. Groh - DA. Davidson & Co.So, what are you saying is old lease rates rolling over you probably get a positive bump up, but as far as current rates are going, you look those to be steady and maybe you've got the fuel headwind that's probably causing those rates to the sort of stay in the same range they're now?David StorchI think that pretty much says it.J.B. Groh - DA. Davidson & Co.And maybe you can talk about your the market for used aircraft and I'd assume that moves not a lock step, but same sort of trend as maybe the overall commercial production and what your strategy is there, I mean I'm guessing that it's A320 family, 737NG type acquisitions.David StorchYeah, I think we haven't yet moved into the NG arena. We are looking today at opportunities in that market, but yeah, the A320 is something we're trafficking in and most of our activity has been in the 737 Classic family, like for instance the acquisition of 18 aircraft from Malaysian Airline system those were 737-400 that were 1992 to 1997 vintage aircraft. And so if you look at the majority of our portfolio would be in that vintage, yet there is a movement for us at least to move that a little bit more current, if you will.J.B. Groh - DA. Davidson & Co.What's the average lease period that you have on the books?David StorchThe average lease of, the kinds of deals that we're entering are mostly in the three to five year range and we do from time-to-time. We are acquiring, looking at aircraft that have longer lease period, maybe coming off of some of the 20 year, 25, 20 year leases, where we come in after the 50 year or something like that. So, but I'd say generally speaking the lease rates for the aircraft that we are trafficking in are in the 3 to 5 year range.J.B. Groh - DA. Davidson & Co.Great, hey thank you for your time and congratulations on the quarter.David StorchThank you.OperatorOur next question or comment comes from the line of Mr. [David Ratlis from Dulcet Company]. Your line is open, sir. Mr. Ratlis you may need to un-mute your phone, sir. Okay, we will return him to the queue. Our next question or comment is from Mr. Eric Hugel from Stephens. Your line is open sir.Eric Hugel - StephensGood morning guys. Good quarter.David StorchThank you.Eric Hugel - StephensHey, can you talk about, I know in the past Dave you talked about the Aviation Supply Chain margin sort of typically bouncing around in the 22 to 24 range, for now this is like the second quarter in a row that we've been at the 24 or sort of a high end of that range, is there something sort of structurally that you've changed, you've improved in this business or are we susceptible to sort of those numbers dropping back down?David StorchWell, we have a leading position in this market. We've been in this business since our founding. So, we understand the aircraft parts market as well as anybody else in the business. We've been able to benefit from our strong balance sheet position. We talked about back in the second quarter in particular, where we acquired fair amount of inventory and that inventory has starting to flow through our system.We have meaningful sales coming out of the investments we've made in the second quarter. We continue to make investments in the third quarter and we've even continue to make investments in the fourth quarter in this business.So, I believe that we've been able to make pretty attractive acquisitions of equipment, and I think you are seeing some of that benefit there in the margin. So how long that sustains itself is a tough question.We're very pleased with the performance of that group and the 24, you are correct, is the upper end to the margins, yet there are still some elements to that business. Our component repair shops, for instance, there are some opportunities there to improve performance. We recently announced a contract for some Army helicopter component repair that should contribute to improved margins in that business.But I think on balance, I think you pretty well said it. I think that we can fluctuate between that 22 and 24. We're running at the high end. How long it stays at 24, I can't really say. We haven't seen a change in trends, but it doesn't mean that there can't be circumstance or situations that may cause that to dip down.Eric Hugel - StephensOkay. Fair enough. Can you talk about, I guess, in terms of your overall operating margin number, I mean you are at that now for a second quarter in a row. You've achieved that 10% sort of target that you had set out. You've got Summa now in the mix, and I'm assuming that there was some nice purchase accounting associated with that in this quarter, yet you still maintain that. You got Avborne coming online. I mean, is it your expectation that with some of these headwinds coming out, I guess, additional purchase accounting that you'd be able to maintain that 10% operating margin going forward?David StorchYeah. Listen, as we make these acquisitions, they've been a little bit of a drag on the margins. So, as we try to normalize the business, my opening comments that the sales growth was 39% if you back out the acquisition. So if you just looked organically, sales growth was 25%, and then if you back out the year-over-year aircraft transactions, sales growth was 19%. We reported 10.1% operating margin, but if you backed out the acquisitions and you backed out the aircraft transactions, operating margins would have been 10.4%.So, the acquisitions we've made have been a little bit of a drag on operating margins for some of the some reasons that you identified. And over time, as we integrate these businesses, it would be our goal to see the operating, these be contributors to our operating margin business. It might be a little tougher for the Avborne business because, by nature, the MRO business has tougher operating margins. But also keep in mind, there is less investments in those business. So, return on capital has been a better measurement for the MRO businesses.Nevertheless, we would expect Tim has numerous initiatives going on around the company. We have lean initiatives in our Indianapolis business, in our landing gear business, in our components shops in New York, and hopefully, eventually in Amsterdam. So, we were looking for ways to drive efficiency through the company.Going back to the performance, goals of the company, we recognize that the growth that we're getting today is largely, we believe, due to taking market share and we're taking that market share because we're performing. We're performing for the customer, but we also recognize, we need to perform for the shareholder. So, in that process we hope to continue down that path of getting to that 12.5% target.It will be, it goes in is and goes out is, and as we absorb these acquisitions at first blush they are a drag, and then, hopefully, we're able to execute and get these margins going in the right direction.Eric Hugel - StephensWith regards to Summa, was there a significant amount of inventory step up that hit you this quarter that would pretty much washout during this quarter and you wouldn't have that headwind going forward?David StorchNo, Eric, nothing that is isolated on a quarter.Eric Hugel - StephensOkay. With regards to Southwest, I guess in the mix of all of these sort of maintenance troubles that they are sort of going through, one of the interesting things that they sort of announced was that they were planning on moving four lines of maintenance to El Salvador, which now they've shelved those plans, and they said all those lines were outsourced in the US to providers.One, were any of those sort of planned lines of maintenance, anything that you guys are doing with them at Indy?And two, are there potential discussion or is there an opportunity that you potentially see now that they are killing those plans to outsource those lines to El Salvador they're going to keep them domestic to get some more additional business there?Tim RomeneskoSo, Eric, the lines that were going to go were not coming out of Indy. Southwest is good customer and we're working with them everyway we can to support them. We've helped them get some of their aircraft back to service, and we're constantly talking to them about ways to be more helpful.Eric Hugel - StephensThe Southwest issues in terms of their maintenance lapses and check, that's all internal to Southwest. That does noting do with third party MRO providers, does it?Tim RomeneskoCorrect.Eric Hugel - StephensOkay.Tim RomeneskoAs David mentioned, it's largely around the paperwork.Eric Hugel - StephensOkay. Also, United, they are a sizeable customer at Indy. They're talking about taking 15 to 20 aircraft out of the mix. They're talking about older domestic aircraft, which to me means their 737s, 300s and 500s, their oldest aircraft in the fleet domestic and you are the exclusive provider of all that maintenance. Are there plans right now, are you in discussions about reducing the number of lines, and then you would have to fill in some additional lines? I know they are flying about 95 37's right now. So reducing 15 to 20 is not the end of world, but is there a potential here that as we get into the back half of the year that you're going to see a line reduction?Tim RomeneskoThere is always a potential. But right now that's not the nature of the conversations we're having with United. So we're prepared for that if that were to happen, but that's not what we're hearing.Eric Hugel - StephensOkay. Tim, can give us an update on where things stand with the component repair business and getting those margins up? I mean we've been, I guess, slower than hoped for, for the last couple of quarters on the trek up from breakeven up to high single digit operating margins. Can you give us sort of a trend of where things are and how much far that we have to go?Rick PoultonDavid has touched on it in his comments. We've got a good start in that. We've won some business recently, some meaningful business. And I think you probably saw that release. We've strengthened the leadership of that business recently that we think is also going to have an impact. We're investing in some process improvement initiative there.So, as David said, I think there is still plenty of upside there but we are starting at the early stages of seeing some improvement.Eric Hugel - StephensWould you say that right now, that sort of business in terms of operating margin is mid single-digit?Rick PoultonYes.Eric Hugel - StephensOkay, great. And then the lastly, just sort of a numbers question, give CapEx for the quarter?Rick PoultonEric, I say mid single-digit or about.Eric Hugel - StephensOkay.Rick PoultonCapEx Eric is just under $80 million for the quarter.Eric Hugel - StephensGreat. Thanks a lot guys, good quarter.Rick PoultonThanks.Operator(Operator Instruction) We have a follow-up from Troy Lahr from Stifel. Your line is open, sir.Troy Lahr - StifelThanks. Just a follow-up question on Indi, you guys talked a lot about still seeing good customer interest there looking to expand the facility. How is the labor market been there? Have you seen improvements there?David StorchI'd say modest improvements, but still I'd say relatively tight.Troy Lahr - StifelOkay. So are wage rates still pretty higher now or have you seen wage rates come down a little bit?David StorchWell, that's so much around the wages I wouldn't say, wages have not come down. I think it's an industry-wide maybe even beyond industry-wide problem getting attracting skilled technical labor.Troy Lahr - StifelOkay.David StorchCertainly not unique to Indianapolis.Troy Lahr - StifelSure. Okay. And then regarding SUMMA Technology, the integration, are you fully done with the integration or can you just maybe update us on that? Did you see any surprises, once you actually acquired the business, kind of maybe what you experienced with Rev Air bear how it cost you a little more to integrate some of that, anything going on like that in SUMMA?David StorchI think the integration has gone quite well. There has been some real solid positive that we have seen and really not any significant negatives.Tim RomeneskoTroy, I would just add to that as David said, it's a additional leg on the stool, so the level of integration I think it's fair to say was a lot lower than it would been at Hot Springs acquisition.Troy Lahr - StifelOkay. And then lastly at the MRO business, I guess couple of quarters ago, you had some problem aircraft contracts comes through, some problem aircraft. Any more of that do you think that's a kind of behind you and kind of understand what have been and you are on the same page with the customer now about what aircraft coming through your facilities?Tim RomeneskoYes.Troy Lahr - StifelCan you elaborate or just--?Tim RomeneskoNo, I mean those issues are well behind us. I think they were a point in time a couple quarters ago and we are not experiencing those difficulties with those airplanes.Troy Lahr - StifelOkay. Are you reworking any additional MRO contracts trying to get better pricing on any of those? I think you went though that in the past on one contract, just wondered is that ongoing?Tim RomeneskoThere is no specific contract kind of contract renegotiation going on. As we look at Avborne and bring on new customers, but I don't think is there anything going on right now in terms of renegotiating the contracts.Troy Lahr - StifelOkay, thanks guys.OperatorOur next question or comment is a follow-up from Mr. Tyler Hojo. Your line is open sir.Tyler Hojo - Sidoti & CompanyTwo quick follow-up. Just in regards to the Indianapolis facility, how many bays are you currently utilizing?David StorchTyler, it changes fairly frequently, but I think at last count we were booking out of eight bays. And we're getting ready to bring the paint bay on as well.Tyler Hojo - Sidoti & CompanyOkay. Great. And lastly, just in terms to your aircraft portfolio, I believe the last time you commented just in terms of the number of aircraft purchase pre-9/11 was the first quarter when there were six. How many are on the books as of today?David StorchThree. I didn't hear -- the question is on the pre-9/11 aircrafts on the books, three.Tyler Hojo - Sidoti & CompanyThree? Okay, great. Thanks.OperatorOur next question or comment comes from Arnie Ursaner from CJS Securities. Your line is open.Arnie Ursaner - CJS SecuritiesHi, good morning. Two very quick questions. One is on the cash that you have on your balance sheet, can you give us a feel for if you have any exposure auction rate notes and what sort of rates you're getting on the cash.Tim RomeneskoNo auction rate notes.David StorchNo exposure, Arnie, and what earnings on that cash, you know, somewhere between 300 and 375 bips.Arnie Ursaner - CJS SecuritiesOkay. And just to be clear, on Southwest did you receive any emergency repair work on this recent announcement, and if so, did it displace other work that you already had in hand?David StorchArnie, we helped Southwest in some of their outstations doing remote overnight inspections, so it didn't displace anything.Arnie Ursaner - CJS SecuritiesBut if you did work in their sites, you had to obviously take some of your key personnel to their site to do it?David StorchIt was not disruptive to our operations in any way.Arnie Ursaner - CJS SecuritiesOkay. Thank you very much.OperatorOur final question will be from Mr. Larry Solow. Mr. Solow, your line is open.Larry Solow - CJS SecuritiesJust one real quickie, any update on the Airbus A400 contract and is there any potential to see revenues in calendar 2008?David StorchIt looks like it's going to be early '09, Larry, when deliveries begin. We're continuing to work with our prime contractor and with Airbus to get the cargo system design finalized and the manufacturing ramped up. So it looks like it's going to be early '09 when it starts to impact revenue throughout.Larry Solow - CJS SecuritiesGreat, okay. Thanks.OperatorGentlemen, we have no additional questions or comments in the queue at this time.David StorchOkay. Well, thank you very much for participating and hopefully we were helpful here today, so have a nice day. Bye-bye.OperatorLadies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference.

Please refer to the forward-looking statement disclaimer contained in the press release issued yesterday as well as those factors discussed under Item 1A entitled ""Risk Factors,"" included in the Company's May 31st, 2008 Form 10-K. By providing forward-looking statements, the Company assumes no obligation to update the forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statements or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events.At this time, I would like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, David Storch.David StorchThank you, Tom, and good morning everyone. Joining me today in our Chicago headquarters is Tim Romenesko, our President and Chief Operating Officer and Rick Poulton, our Chief Financial Officer.We reported our third quarter results last night and trust that youâve had a chance to review our press release. As you all know, the economic environment in the United States has continued to deteriorate with calendar year fourth quarter GDP a negative 6.2% and U.S. unemployment at the highest rate since 1983. As a result of weak economic conditions, both business and leisure travelers have reduced air travel, causing airlines to reduce capacity and seek ways to reduce cost, and conserve cash.Capacity in North America is down approximately 8% during the first quarter of calendar year 2009 compared to last year and passenger traffic in North America is down approximately 10%. International traffic for certain of the carriers is worse with some carriers reporting declines in international traffic well in excess of 10%. While carriers are benefiting from the impact of lower jet fuel prices, additional capacity reductions may occur as a result of continued weakness and consumer confidence and declining business travel.As airlines reduce capacity, it causes significant changes to their maintenance schedules, which in turn drives disruption to the demand pull for parts and services. Now, we have not been immune to the capacity reductions impacting the industry as we reported a 6.8% decline in sales to commercial customers, which excludes our Aircraft Sales and Leasing business.We were impacted at our Indianapolis MRO where we experienced lower sales as a result of the United Airlines decision last spring to ground their 737-300 fleet as well as FedExâs decision to retire a portion of their 727 aircraft. We are in discussions with other potential customers who have expressed interest in this world-class facility and we continue to perform work for Southwest.As a result of the weak economic conditions and tight credit markets, we are focused on reducing our investment in our aircraft portfolio. Our equity investment in our joint venture and wholly-owned aircraft portfolio is approximately $80 million at February 28, 2009. Of the 33 aircrafts in our portfolio, 32 aircraft are on lease and we have only â and we have one wholly-owned aircraft coming off lease in the fourth quarter, which will be disassembled for parts.There are two leased aircrafts on our wholly-owned portfolio in which the lessee is behind in their payments. Weâve obtained the judgment against the parent of the operator of the aircrafts and expect to recover amounts owed to us. Other than those two aircrafts, all the other aircrafts continue to operate according to our agreements.Further, as we deemphasize this business, we are considering combining the activities of our Aircraft Sales and Leasing segment with the Aviation Supply Chain segment for our next fiscal year.While the environment remains challenging, we believe the business strategy we adopted several years ago has positioned us well to respond to these challenges. Specifically, through target investments and business acquisitions as well as organic growth, weâve been executing a strategy of building balance, balance across our two major customer segments, commercial and defense, as well as balance in our product and services offerings between front-end manufactured content and back-end aftermarket support.Our goals in embarking on this strategy have always been two-fold, first, to mitigate short term earnings volatility by insulating our exposure to any one segment of industry, and, second, to generate opportunity over the longer term by creating larger addressable market opportunities.Looking back on our third quarter, we see the value in executing this strategy as our results held up nicely despite a very difficult commercial environment and certainly held up much better than weâve seen in prior downturns. We remain optimistic on longer term fundamentals for both the commercial and defense markets we serve and continue to position ourselves for long term success. For example, we recently opened an office in Abu Dhabi, which is staffed by one of our senior marketing executives to address growing opportunities in this region and we expect to see results shortly. And I should say meaningful results.In yesterdayâs release, we discussed that we were a net investor of cash during the third quarter. We used $16 million of cash from operations as we made significant investments in inventory and rotable assets to support our commercial customers. We expect cash â solid cash from operations in the fourth quarter as we do not have any large planned asset purchases.Thank you all for joining the conference call today. And we would like to now open up the line for any questions you may have.Question-and-Answer SessionOperator(Operator instructions) Our first question is from Larry Solow of CJS Securities. Your line is open.Larry Solow â CJS SecuritiesHi good morning. Can you maybe discuss your Aviation Supply, it looks like your margins actually were, it surprised me, held up pretty well, obviously I know they have the last couple of quarters, but are the â first of all, the bigger ticket items, are those lower margin? Were you â kind of your sales were kind of down a little bit and was it due to better mix or what was the color on that?Tim RomeneskoWell, I think the â I think, Larry, the â but just the volumes were lower in big ticket items and at the components shop.Larry Solow â CJS SecuritiesRight.Tim RomeneskoAnd the margin on big ticket items can â itâs volatile. They are â sometimes they are modest, but other times they can be significant. So, I think you have just a â recently experienced in the quarter just a general softness in demand for parts and then it was exacerbated by the lack of any engines or large structural components.Rick PoultonLarry, itâs Rick. Iâd just add to what Tim said (inaudible) by pointing out that as part of what we described is some of the revenue weakness, which was really out of our component repair shops. Those tend to be a little lower margin than the other aspects inside Supply Chain. So you are getting a little bit of margin left as those things show some softness.Larry Solow â CJS SecuritiesGot it. And I know youâve had some weakness in the European component shop and you talked about some potential actions taken and I guess I see youâve had some headcount reductions there and severance costs. Any other actions you could take or â?Tim RomeneskoWe are working it. We are working both the cost side and the business development side. Weâve â weâve moved a team in there now and working on improving the performance there. Weâve got some things that we are working on that are going to help. So, itâs a priority.Larry Solow â CJS SecuritiesGot you. And then just last question. Can you, Tim, maybe just discuss â I see recent â looks like recent trends are at least stabilizing. You mentioned last couple of weeks in you press release kind of during the quarter did things get progressively worse in the Aviation Supply as capacity started to come off or how that play itself out?Tim RomeneskoNo, the â it got better actually. February was a strong month and we are seeing the volumes in March continue to track.Larry Solow â CJS SecuritiesOkay. And then in MRO, in the Indianapolis facility, could you just give us the update, I guess itâs only Southwestern now and how many hangers are we occupying?Tim RomeneskoItâs fluctuating between seven and eight.Larry Solow â CJS SecuritiesOkay. Thatâs all Southwest?Tim RomeneskoCorrect.Larry Solow â CJS SecuritiesOkay.Tim RomeneskoBut that includes some wing at work and things like that that are â produce less revenue than solid â the maintenance line.Larry Solow â CJS SecuritiesOkay.Tim RomeneskoSo, the hanger count is not necessarily indicative of the activity level.Larry Solow â CJS SecuritiesGot you. Okay good. Thank you.OperatorThank you, sir. Our next question or comment is from Tyler Hojo of Sidoti and Company. Your line is open.Tyler Hojo â Sidoti & CompanyGood morning. Just quickly on the 33 aircraft that you guys owned, how does that break between JV and wholly-owned.David Storch26 JV, Tyler, and seven wholly-owned.Tyler Hojo â Sidoti & CompanyOkay great. And I was hoping that maybe you could comment a little bit just in regards to the work stoppage in the Miami Landing Gear facility. Maybe if you can quantify what the impact in the quarter was and how maybe that is going to impact any potential sequential uptick in business in the fourth quarter.David StorchTyler, we think that the impact on revenue was between $3 million and $3.5 million. We expect to have that flow through relatively quickly. The rework thatâs being done is in process. So I think weâll be through the bulk of that in Q4 and in Q1. We think that the margin and the operating income impact is about $1 million from â that came out of the third quarter that will go into Q4 and Q1.Tyler Hojo â Sidoti & CompanyOkay. And I guess just based on some of your prepared comments there I mean is it safe to say that you really donât have a whole lot of visibility and I guess just using Indy as an example with the seven to eight days just in regards to that capacity going up or staying stable or going down, I mean is still visibility just not very good in order to maybe comment further there?Tim RomeneskoNo, I think we have fairly decent visibility. I mean we feel very good about our relationship with the customer we have today. And obviously weâve been working diligently of late to replace the business that disappears as a result of grounding. And we have some stuff that we are working on that we â we feel our capture rate â we have confidence in our ability to capture some of the stuff that we are looking at.Tyler Hojo â Sidoti & CompanyOkay.Tim RomeneskoWe would anticipate that Indianapolis a year from now will be in stronger position than it is today.Tyler Hojo â Sidoti & CompanyAlight. And the work with Southwest, the expectation was that going to go up in the fourth quarter. Is that correct?Tim RomeneskoI donât know that for sure. I think there is changes in Southwest re-planning as well. So I wouldnât count on that.Tyler Hojo â Sidoti & CompanyOkay. Alright great. Thanks very much.OperatorThank you. Our next question or comment comes from Eric Hugel of Stephens Inc. Your line is open.Eric Hugel â Stephens Inc.Hey, good morning guys.David StorchEric, good morning.Eric Hugel â Stephens Inc.Can you comment â I mean, I guess one of the key buzzwords that weâve been hearing from a lot of your I guess fellow aftermarket peers has been even over and above sort of the weak traffic numbers weâve been seeing, sort of trends of airline de-stocking. But those trends donât seem to â they only last a couple of quarters. Can you talk to us about where you think we are in that cycle and sort of â it is maybe February and March improving, maybe a sign that we are close to the end of sort of these de-stocking?David StorchI think itâs hard to predict, Eric, only as it relates to â try and understand whatâs happening to the fleets. I think if the fleet stabilize you are probably correct, but if the fleets continue to come down a little bit then you could have more of that effect going forward. But our sense is that if you track the business on a weekly basis, obviously, which we are doing, the business is showing some strength. So, there demand seems to be stabilizing if you will, possibly increasing slightly.Eric Hugel â Stephens Inc.Okay.Tim RomeneskoWe clearly had a low back in December and weâve seen some pickup since then.Eric Hugel â Stephens Inc.Okay great. With regards to â I guess you recently, I guess maybe a couple of months back, there was a big award that you guys won, I guess it was make tactical shelters for the FMTV, but I guess was supposed to start up this in the third quarter and I guess ramp to maybe full by the fourth quarter. Is that sort of on track, is that how we should be thinking about it?David StorchIt is on track. It is on track, Eric, and it is.Eric Hugel â Stephens Inc.Okay. Are there any other big sort of programs? You referred to a couple of them because I mean your defense numbers looked really strong.David StorchYou know, the numbers are strong. The performance, particularly at the mobility systems business is strong. Weâre continuing to add to the â win new business at least and we are doing a good job delivering against our backlog.Eric Hugel â Stephens Inc.Can you talk about the sustainability of that kind of growth of maybe high-single digit growth? Is that sustainable or is like maybe the revenue level is sustainable?David StorchNo, I think there is going to be at least a modest uptick in revenue and the outlook continues to be good through our early fiscal 2011. So, we are encouraged.Eric Hugel â Stephens Inc.Can you comment on defense side also on the performance based logistics opportunities you are seeing out there?David StorchThere is opportunities that we are working. Clearly, we are continuing to execute well on the programs that we have and we are looking to add to them.Eric Hugel â Stephens Inc.But nothing that we would â nothing material that you would prefer to think is in relative near term, just sort of just general environment?David StorchRight.Eric Hugel â Stephens Inc.Okay. Thanks a lot guys. I get back into the queue.OperatorThank you, sir. Our next question is from Jim Okshow [ph] of ABH [ph]. Sir, your line is open.Jim Okshow â ABHGood morning, gentlemen. I got a couple of questions relating to the aircraft leasing, both the planes you outright and the joint venture. First of all, do you have any leases that are expiring this year?David StorchWe had a lease, as we indicated, that expires this quarter. The aircraft comes off lease in May. And the aircraft is attractively priced. Itâs wholly owned by the Company and the aircraft will go into disassembly where we have demand for the parts for those â for that aircraft. We have â other than that, I donât believe we have any other aircrafts that come due this fiscal year or this calendarâ-Tim RomeneskoJust the one. We do have some âlater in the calendar year.Jim Okshow â ABHHow many later in the year, in the calendar year?Tim RomeneskoFor the full fiscal year â10, we have â itâs either six or seven repricing. They donât start until Q2 and they are spread out to the balance of the year. So, I am just going to (inaudible) my head here, but itâs somewhere in the three to four range probably.Jim Okshow â ABHYou just said repricing, what does that mean?Tim RomeneskoMeaning leases coming to term.Jim Okshow â ABHOkay, okay. Could you give a breakdown of what kind of aircraft you have in the fleet, I mean how many â I donât know if you want to go plane-by-plane, but how many are new generation and how many narrow bodies and how many wide bodies?David StorchWe have three wide bodies. We have two 767-300s on lease long term with United. And we have one 747-400 on lease with Northwest-Delta. We then have two A320s on lease and we â I am sorry, we have three A320s on lease. And then we have â the balance of the fleet would be 737s 300s and 400s and one 737-500.Jim Okshow â ABHOkay. The â just final questions and put together. First of all, do you anticipate particularly with the 737s any need for any writedowns and in light of what you said about deemphasizing this business, are you planning to offer any of these planes â any of the planes in the fleet for sale?David StorchWell, we do have â a couple of the airplanes are offered for sale, but at this moment we think we have a good position in the aircraft. And we are deemphasizing because the capital markets are not extremely bullish in this kind of activity. So, we are not â we donât see the same opportunities. There is a huge spread between what buyers want to pay and what sellers think the assets are worth and we see that continuing for a period of time.Jim Okshow â ABHOkay. So, when you say deemphasize, does that mean just that you are not going to be looking to add more planes or (inaudible) act at looking at get out of this business and sell what you have?David StorchWell, I think clearly on the front-end, where we havenât added an aircraft into our portfolio since Novemberâ07, so I think that the facts speak for themselves in that regard in terms of adding. And in terms of selling we have sold â we have been a seller of these aircrafts since then. We continue to operate the leases and look for opportunities to sell the assets. So that would be the way I would characterize it.Jim Okshow â ABHThank you very much.David StorchYes.OperatorThank you. Our next question or comment comes from Tom Louis [ph] of (inaudible). Your line is open.Tom LouisYes, good morning.David StorchHi Tom.Tom LouisI was hoping for a little clarification on â you are clearly, you are enjoying a nice â some nice growth in your mobility business. Can you talk a little bit about the extent to which this might be due to capabilities youâve added in the last few years as opposed to just the governmentâs need to protect its presence? Also, can you talk about the â what sort of visibility you might have against the day that this is not going to be a source of growth anymore and about your alternative uses for these capabilities or your ability to otherwise manage those assets at reduced volumes.David StorchWell, the first part of your question, Tom, is weâve expanded our product line quite dramatically. We made the acquisition of Brown Engineering a couple of years back and â a year and a half back or so, and Brown Engineering gets us into the command and communications world and environment. We think that world continues to show opportunities going forward. We feel good about the breadth of the product line today versus where it was in the past. We have capability â we are now â have these mobile shelters that â going on the back of the trucks and things of that nature. We are getting a lot better at stuffing the shelters than we were in the past. So, yes, I think the product line is definitely broader than it was in the past.And I think as it relates to moving forward, as I said in my opening comments, we feel very good about the balance to our portfolio that we have today and historically when the commercial airline business has been a little softer that business has been a little stronger and vice versa to some extent as well. So, I think that the story is around how we are fairing through this downturn versus how we faired through previous downturns, which youâve been with us through. And I think that this â I think we are in a good position in that business. I donât see world tensions diminishing in an appreciable fashion. They may move from theater to theater, but clearly the U.S.â capability of moving into different theaters becomes more pressing and â one theater thatâs developing, quite frankly, for the Company is the Southwest United States. And so there is I think broad range of applications for our product today as the product continues to broaden itself.Tom LouisSo, maybe moving to Texas wasnât such good idea. Okay. Now, with respect to the Aircraft Sales and Leasing, is there anything in this year your willingness to â or your decision to talking to deemphasizing, I mean youâve got â clearly, where we are cyclically speaking and the state of the â present state of the capital markets, but if we think of this business compared to maybe the way we would have perceived it five of ten years ago, is there more to it than that or is it those two factors?David StorchI think itâs also resource allocation for AAR. We see greater opportunities else where. And we feel really good about our positions in the other three markets. And this market â weâve always been just a dabbler in that market and I think itâs time for us at least to dabble a little bit less.Tom LouisOkay. And just one last question kind of under the vein of resource allocation. You had the opportunity during the quarter to buy back some of your converts. It was real obviously early in the quarter prior to the end of the last calendar year that there were a lot of motivated sellers among the holders of various convertible bonds out there. My sense is itâs a lot less so, but do you still see an opportunity to meet with a motivated potential â with motivated sellers on this part of managing your capital structure.David StorchYes, Tom, from time to time we are getting phone calls from capital market folks who were representing people who have bonds that they would like to liquefy. So that has not â that has not diminished. And I can't really tell you what thatâs going to look like 90 days from now, but as we sit here today they are still â those opportunities still do exist for the Company.Tom LouisOkay great. Thanks a lot guys.David StorchYes.OperatorYes, thank you, sir. Our next question or comment is from Jon Braatz of Kansas City Capital. Your line is open.Jon Braatz â Kansas City CapitalGood morning gentlemen.David StorchGood morning.Jon Braatz â Kansas City CapitalWhen we look at the MRO facility in Indianapolis, did we see the full brunt of the slowdown in the loss of FedEx and United Airlines in the quarter or did that get progressively worse as the quarter progressed?David StorchNo, you saw the full brunt within the quarter.Jon Braatz â Kansas City CapitalOkay alright. And then secondly, during the year we saw there were a couple of FAA issues, Landing Gear and on the Boeing plant I think it was, is there anything you can do to I guess I donât want to â and I donât want to assign blame or anything like that â to be somewhat more proactive or work with the FAA more quickly so that these things donât get out into the public view because that will cause a little bit of a investor anxiety? But is there anything that can be done in a private manner so that these things are resolved, letâs say, more quickly?David StorchAbsolutely. We could have done a better job here. And we have a lesson learned, if you will, a tough lesson, a hard lesson. And shame on us to some extent. But, yes, definitely we are much more cognizant. It was an unfortunate wake up call in this context. But keep in mind now, safety of flight was never an issue, quality was never an issue, more about relationship management more than anything else. And, yes, we can do a better job in the relationship management. And I have â since this even, I have held meetings with the senior people from the flight safety and flight standards group within the FAA in Washington, D.C., and I will be meeting on a one-on-one basis with the head of the Miami (inaudible) on April 6. So, yes, clearly, we could have been â done a better job at the front end here.Jon Braatz â Kansas City CapitalOkay, David, is it true, is my understanding correct that letâs say an FAA inspector in Oklahoma could have a different interpretation of the rules of an FAA inspector in Miami? Is it â?David StorchI donât know. I won't necessarily characterize it that way, but I would say that the local SIFDOs [ph] are powerful in and of themselves and need to be reckoned with in their â in the â on the locale in which they are operating. But, yes, I mean in this case here weâve been in the Miami operation now since late 80s. Weâve had relationship where we let the relationships â my interpretation is that we let the relationship get away from us. And we have to do a better job on the front-end in that relationship aspect.Jon Braatz â Kansas City CapitalOkay. Alright. Thank you.David StorchYes. But you should know also that the FAA holds the Company in very high regard, and that was conveyed to me when I was in D.C., and like I said â I just want to reiterate it, this was never a safety of flight issue, never a quality issue. And as you can tell, the parts have not been recalled or anything of that nature. So â okay.Jon Braatz â Kansas City CapitalI understand. Thank you.David StorchOkay. Alright.OperatorThank you. Our next question or comment comes from JB Groh of DA Davidson. Your line is open.JB Groh â DA Davidson & Co.Good morning guys. Just a couple clarification questions on the margins. On the Structures the margin came down a little bit sequentially, is that just a mix issue or â what â remind me why it was so strong last quarter and dropped a little bit this quarter.Tim RomeneskoI think if you looked historically, JB, youâd see that this quarterâs performance is sort of more in line with what you would you have â what would youâve seen as trend line â weâve been fractioning [ph] up the margin in this area, but somewhere in the 15% [ph] or just under is more in line with what youâve seen historically. So, last quarterâs was a little bit of an aberration. And it was product mix or anything.JB Groh â DA Davidson & Co.Okay. And then on the Aircraft Sales and Leasing (inaudible) that looks kind of strange, is that due to the parting out of the aircraft or what makes that number look a little odd?Tim RomeneskoSorry, which number â?JB Groh â DA Davidson & Co.In the Aircraft Sales and Leasing â?Tim RomeneskoGross profit or â?JB Groh â DA Davidson & Co.Yes, gross â I mean it shows up, itâs like a 50% gross profit margin. I am just guessing that has something to do with parting out the aircraft or â?Tim RomeneskoYes, itâs really just â itâs just least revenue. That tends to be a very high margin area when you have very little revenue. So, in the past, if you look back, when we sell an aircraft from our own portfolio, you have more sales and then you sort to actually have a slightly lower margin. But the lease revenue on â which doesnât show up as a â it tends to be a very high margin area, J. B., so I think itâs just a kind of a (inaudible) small number soâJB Groh â DA Davidson & Co.Okay. Okay. Okay. And then I donât know, I am not sure if you gave a depreciation and amortization number for the quarter.Rick PoultonWe gave some (inaudible) itâs $9.7 million for the quarter.JB Groh â DA Davidson & Co.Okay. Thanks a lot. Thatâs all I have.OperatorThank you, sir. Our next question or comment is from Henry Kennedy [ph] of Overhaul and Maintenance [ph]. Your line is open.Henry Kennedy â Overhaul and MaintenanceHi good morning. You mentioned before that your long term strategy includes growth, internal growth and acquisitions. Could you speak a little bit about what kind of acquisitions you might at least be interested in over the next year, where they might be or are you looking at anything in commercial overhaul or you are trying to sort of balance your portfolio away from commercial overhaul?Henry Kennedy â Overhaul and Maintenance:Tim RomeneskoHenry, the comment, you know â just to be clear â the comment upfront was that we had made acquisitions and investments and targeted some of our organic growth in a (inaudible) enterprise. So, going backwards, there was an effort to get more defense exposure, little more front-end content exposure and thatâs where we had been emphasizing. As we look ahead, we continue to see organic investment opportunities as well as acquisition opportunities, are all ways of â for us of using some of the cash we generate. I donât know that we have a specific priority right now, but we are interested in serving both major customer segments and we are interested in continuing to serve them both with front-end content as well as aftermarket services. So, I think all of the above are in solutions for us.Henry Kennedy â Overhaul and MaintenanceOkay. Thank you.OperatorThank you. Our next question or comment is from Rick [ph] of Columbia Management. Your line is open.Rick â Columbia ManagementYes, just a follow-up on the Landing Gear shutdown. Has there â can you characterize the customer response once you were back up running, I guess, only five days later, has there been any kind of backlash or negative response.Tim RomeneskoNo. I would say there was concern obviously around the disruption as we were going through it, but we tried to keep the customers as current as we could in terms of what was happening. Since itâs been resolved, weâve been visited by all of our customers, basically. And I would say that there is no backlash, if you will, in terms of gear coming into the facility for repair.Rick â Columbia ManagementSo, you donât expect to lose any material business from that event?Tim RomeneskoThatâs right. And we are working hard to make sure that that doesnât happen.Rick â Columbia ManagementOkay. Thank you very much.OperatorThank you. And our next question or comment is from Larry Solow of CJS Securities. Your line is open.Larry Solow â CJS SecuritiesJust a follow-up to Rickâs comments and I believe someone else asked about Southwest, if I am not mistaken, did Southwest recently actually expand their relationship on â with your Landing Gear Services?Tim RomeneskoWe do Landing Gear for Southwest, yes?Larry Solow â CJS SecuritiesWell, didnât they â I think I read in one of the aviation magazines, they actually increased their exposure I mean or their â I guess their planned volume in you facility, is that incorrect or â?Tim RomeneskoNo, I am sure that thatâs correct.Larry Solow â CJS SecuritiesOkay. Just one question on SG&A. It seems like if you strip out the severance and (inaudible) thatâs flat on a year-over-year basis, is that a kind of a good way to look at it going forward or  â?Rick PoultonIn absolute dollars, Larry, thatâs â you are correct in your assessment and â yes, I mean we are very focused on managing SG&A, very focused given the environment.Larry Solow â CJS SecuritiesOkay. And then just last question. Any color â how about the other â the MRO facilities at Oklahoma doing and (inaudible)?David StorchThey are both busy.Larry Solow â CJS SecuritiesOkay. Thatâs good. Okay good. Thanks.OperatorThank you. Our next question or comment is from Stan Mann [ph] of Mann Family Investment [ph]. Your line is open.Stan Mann â Mann Family InvestmentGood morning gentlemen. I have a question on, one, on use of cash. You did comment that you â possibly on acquisitions, et cetera. In this current market with financing not available, would you say the use of cash would be more for buying and converts and maybe paying down debt, et cetera? So, could you comment on your â the way you view use of cash in this environment?David StorchStan, first of all, hello.Stan Mann â Mann Family InvestmentHello.David StorchBeen a while. Okay, good morning. You know, I think itâs around balance. Itâs clearly looking for â our first use of cash is â itâs all around yield and return on capital, so wherever we feel we can get the best return for our capital. Right now, if you look at the (inaudible) we felt very good about putting some capital to work, taking advantage of some buying opportunities. And we put some capital to work on investment in longer lived assets. We, for instance, acquired a ship set, a 777 landing gear for approximately $8 million from Delta Airlines and secured a multi-year contract from them as a result of putting that capital to work.We also acquired some bonds that we felt were attractively priced. As you can see, we have a 9% yield. Our cost of incremental capital is â or incremental dollars is â itâs a real positive arbitrage for us, let me put it that way. So, yes, I think itâs a balance. You know, we are constantly looking for ways to maximize the dollars that we put to work.Stan Mann â Mann Family InvestmentWell, what I was getting at it itâs less likely that weâll see a large acquisition as we had seen in the past couple of years in the current environment thatâs all I was asking.David StorchYes, I would say that if we were to do an acquisition, it would be obviously accretive, first of all. Secondly, I think weâd be looking for a way to finance it that would be appropriate. But at this moment, we have a couple of minor situations that we are looking at in the overall scheme of things and, yes, so I think the opportunity would have to be a good opportunity that made sense for our portfolio.Stan Mann â Mann Family InvestmentOkay. Second question on operating margin, it slipped, obviously. So, if you put back some of the non-recurring severance, et cetera, do you still see your near term goals above 10% operating margin?David StorchYes.Stan Mann â Mann Family InvestmentSeems like we reached pretty close in this quarter to back things thenâDavid StorchYes, yes correct.Stan Mann â Mann Family InvestmentSo, youâDavid StorchAnd itâs hard, but yes that âStan Mann â Mann Family InvestmentYes.David StorchKeep in mind, also, a piece of the strategy to get the margins from 10% to 12.5% for instance is around the Aircraft Sales and Leasing portfolio. So, we are going to be diminishing that. And that will add a â create a little bit more pressure on bringing the margins up in the short term.Stan Mann â Mann Family InvestmentIn the short term. Well you still have moved up operating profit dollars tremendously in the last three, four years. So âDavid StorchThatâs âStan Mann â Mann Family InvestmentItâs a really different ball game.David StorchYes, thatâs correct.Stan Mann â Mann Family InvestmentAnyway, I think itâs a good job in this environment. Thank you.David StorchThank you very much.OperatorThank you. Our next question or comment is from Eric Hugel of Stephens Inc. Your line is open.Eric Hugel â Stephens Inc.Hey guys, just a couple of follow-ups. The MRO segment, I guess, 2.9% growth year-over-year, but you had the Avborne acquisition in there. What was the organic growth or what was Avborne round about?Rick PoultonAvborne â weâve talked in the past about the size of Avborne, and so just to reiterate that, thatâs somewhere between $10 million and $15 million per quarter, okay? So, I won't get anymore specific than that but you can kind of play around with the numbers based on that information.Eric Hugel â Stephens Inc.Alright. So the organic growth in that business was something like maybe 10% to 13%, 10% to 15% or something like that and that would have been impacted by the MRO (inaudible) by the landing gear [ph]. Okay.Second, can you talk about the Aviation Supply Chain, one of the impacts â and I just trying to sort of work my brain through â I mean you talked about the FX impact. Is that FX impact more sort of just visual in terms of your having lower sales, but higher operating income or is there no net impact or are there real sort of EPS impacts there?Rick PoultonThe EPS impact would be much more modest, so thatâs why we are not really talking about it in EPS level. We have a pretty good natural hedge to the operation. But on the top line you see the impact.Eric Hugel â Stephens Inc.Can you talk about how much the top line impact was with regards to FX?Rick PoultonIt was in the neighborhood of a couple of million dollars, Eric.Eric Hugel â Stephens Inc.Okay. What was CapEx in the quarter?Rick PoultonJust under $7 million â $6.8 million.Eric Hugel â Stephens Inc.Can you give us an update on how things are going with regards to the ramp up on the new composites expansion as well as how things are going with Summa, I know there are some headwinds there with regards to Gulfstream.Tim RomeneskoOn composites, the Sacramento facility is up and running. The â looking for â looking some more work, but nonetheless operating. In terms of Summa, the volumes continue to be strong there. We are looking â I am actually going to be visiting there this afternoon. We are encouraged by some of the prospects we have down there. We do have some work to do on some particular programs. But weâll work on those, weâll work through them.So, I think on balance, I think we feel good about whatâs going on down at Summa.Eric Hugel â Stephens Inc.Okay. Can you give us â maybe a round a ballpark figure as to sort of this new composites facility? I mean is it sort of delivering meaningful additional contribution or is this still just pretty small right now.Tim RomeneskoNo, itâs still small, but itâs â it positions us very nicely as the â as demand for composite materials increases. So, itâs a great facility with tremendous capability that puts us in a nice place in a market that we see as really taking off here in the next three to five years.Eric Hugel â Stephens Inc.And your goal is still over that time period what you said $80 million to $90 million of sales?David StorchWell, we are looking at for the âthe composite business in total is $100 million for the two businesses.Eric Hugel â Stephens Inc.Okay.David StorchWe are doing today roughly what $35 million â approximately $35 million today, we are looking to get to $100 million in five years. Thatâs in our plan. Now, we have two â if you look at the operation now in Sacramento, we have two very large defense oriented contracts that are being worked at this â at this time. And too hard to handicap whether weâll be successful or not, but if we are, weâll get to that target quicker, sooner rather than later.Eric Hugel â Stephens Inc.Great. Thatâs perfect. Thanks a lot guys.OperatorThank you, ladies and gentlemen. Our next question is from Tyler Hojo of Sidoti and Company. Your line is open.Tyler Hojo â Sidoti & CompanyYou guys just answered my follow-up question. Thanks.OperatorThank you, sir. Our next follow-up is from JB Groh of DA Davidson. Your line is open.JB Groh â DA Davidson & Co.Yes, one more question. Just on inventory, is there a way to look at that in terms of ageing and quality in light of all these retirements that we are seeing, is there a way you can sort of give us a framework to think about that?Rick PoultonYes, I mean J.B., we monitor that closely by looking at turns data and we also do look at ageing data for our inventory. And our â we havenât seen any fall back in our major metrics there. And so in particular ageing more than about 85% of the inventory balance has been acquired within the â is less than 18 months. And so we feel pretty good about our carrying values in that product.JB Groh â DA Davidson & Co.Okay. So, thatâs 85% less than â okay, thatâs good. Thank you.OperatorThank you. And I show no further questions or comments at this time, sir.David StorchWell, thank you very much for your participation today. Have a nice day.

At this time, I would like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, David Storch.
David Storch
Thank you, Tom, and good morning everyone. Joining me today in our Chicago headquarters is Tim Romenesko, our President and Chief Operating Officer and Rick Poulton, our Chief Financial Officer.
We reported our third quarter results last night and trust that youâve had a chance to review our press release. As you all know, the economic environment in the United States has continued to deteriorate with calendar year fourth quarter GDP a negative 6.2% and U.S. unemployment at the highest rate since 1983. As a result of weak economic conditions, both business and leisure travelers have reduced air travel, causing airlines to reduce capacity and seek ways to reduce cost, and conserve cash.
Capacity in North America is down approximately 8% during the first quarter of calendar year 2009 compared to last year and passenger traffic in North America is down approximately 10%. International traffic for certain of the carriers is worse with some carriers reporting declines in international traffic well in excess of 10%. While carriers are benefiting from the impact of lower jet fuel prices, additional capacity reductions may occur as a result of continued weakness and consumer confidence and declining business travel.
As airlines reduce capacity, it causes significant changes to their maintenance schedules, which in turn drives disruption to the demand pull for parts and services. Now, we have not been immune to the capacity reductions impacting the industry as we reported a 6.8% decline in sales to commercial customers, which excludes our Aircraft Sales and Leasing business.
We were impacted at our Indianapolis MRO where we experienced lower sales as a result of the United Airlines decision last spring to ground their 737-300 fleet as well as FedExâs decision to retire a portion of their 727 aircraft. We are in discussions with other potential customers who have expressed interest in this world-class facility and we continue to perform work for Southwest.

As a result of the weak economic conditions and tight credit markets, we are focused on reducing our investment in our aircraft portfolio. Our equity investment in our joint venture and wholly-owned aircraft portfolio is approximately $80 million at February 28, 2009. Of the 33 aircrafts in our portfolio, 32 aircraft are on lease and we have only â and we have one wholly-owned aircraft coming off lease in the fourth quarter, which will be disassembled for parts.
There are two leased aircrafts on our wholly-owned portfolio in which the lessee is behind in their payments. Weâve obtained the judgment against the parent of the operator of the aircrafts and expect to recover amounts owed to us. Other than those two aircrafts, all the other aircrafts continue to operate according to our agreements.
Further, as we deemphasize this business, we are considering combining the activities of our Aircraft Sales and Leasing segment with the Aviation Supply Chain segment for our next fiscal year.
While the environment remains challenging, we believe the business strategy we adopted several years ago has positioned us well to respond to these challenges. Specifically, through target investments and business acquisitions as well as organic growth, weâve been executing a strategy of building balance, balance across our two major customer segments, commercial and defense, as well as balance in our product and services offerings between front-end manufactured content and back-end aftermarket support.
Our goals in embarking on this strategy have always been two-fold, first, to mitigate short term earnings volatility by insulating our exposure to any one segment of industry, and, second, to generate opportunity over the longer term by creating larger addressable market opportunities.
Looking back on our third quarter, we see the value in executing this strategy as our results held up nicely despite a very difficult commercial environment and certainly held up much better than weâve seen in prior downturns. We remain optimistic on longer term fundamentals for both the commercial and defense markets we serve and continue to position ourselves for long term success. For example, we recently opened an office in Abu Dhabi, which is staffed by one of our senior marketing executives to address growing opportunities in this region and we expect to see results shortly. And I should say meaningful results.
In yesterdayâs release, we discussed that we were a net investor of cash during the third quarter. We used $16 million of cash from operations as we made significant investments in inventory and rotable assets to support our commercial customers. We expect cash â solid cash from operations in the fourth quarter as we do not have any large planned asset purchases.
Thank you all for joining the conference call today. And we would like to now open up the line for any questions you may have.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
(Operator instructions) Our first question is from Larry Solow of CJS Securities. Your line is open.
Larry Solow â CJS Securities
Hi good morning. Can you maybe discuss your Aviation Supply, it looks like your margins actually were, it surprised me, held up pretty well, obviously I know they have the last couple of quarters, but are the â first of all, the bigger ticket items, are those lower margin? Were you â kind of your sales were kind of down a little bit and was it due to better mix or what was the color on that?
Tim Romenesko
Well, I think the â I think, Larry, the â but just the volumes were lower in big ticket items and at the components shop.
Larry Solow â CJS Securities
Right.
Tim Romenesko
And the margin on big ticket items can â itâs volatile. They are â sometimes they are modest, but other times they can be significant. So, I think you have just a â recently experienced in the quarter just a general softness in demand for parts and then it was exacerbated by the lack of any engines or large structural components.

Rick Poulton
Larry, itâs Rick. Iâd just add to what Tim said (inaudible) by pointing out that as part of what we described is some of the revenue weakness, which was really out of our component repair shops. Those tend to be a little lower margin than the other aspects inside Supply Chain. So you are getting a little bit of margin left as those things show some softness.
Larry Solow â CJS Securities
Got it. And I know youâve had some weakness in the European component shop and you talked about some potential actions taken and I guess I see youâve had some headcount reductions there and severance costs. Any other actions you could take or â?
Tim Romenesko
We are working it. We are working both the cost side and the business development side. Weâve â weâve moved a team in there now and working on improving the performance there. Weâve got some things that we are working on that are going to help. So, itâs a priority.
Larry Solow â CJS Securities
Got you. And then just last question. Can you, Tim, maybe just discuss â I see recent â looks like recent trends are at least stabilizing. You mentioned last couple of weeks in you press release kind of during the quarter did things get progressively worse in the Aviation Supply as capacity started to come off or how that play itself out?
Tim Romenesko
No, the â it got better actually. February was a strong month and we are seeing the volumes in March continue to track.
Larry Solow â CJS Securities
Okay. And then in MRO, in the Indianapolis facility, could you just give us the update, I guess itâs only Southwestern now and how many hangers are we occupying?
Tim Romenesko
Itâs fluctuating between seven and eight.
Larry Solow â CJS Securities
Okay. Thatâs all Southwest?
Tim Romenesko
Correct.
Larry Solow â CJS Securities
Okay.
Tim Romenesko
But that includes some wing at work and things like that that are â produce less revenue than solid â the maintenance line.
Larry Solow â CJS Securities
Okay.
Tim Romenesko
So, the hanger count is not necessarily indicative of the activity level.
Larry Solow â CJS Securities
Got you. Okay good. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you, sir. Our next question or comment is from Tyler Hojo of Sidoti and Company. Your line is open.
Tyler Hojo â Sidoti & Company
Good morning. Just quickly on the 33 aircraft that you guys owned, how does that break between JV and wholly-owned.
David Storch
26 JV, Tyler, and seven wholly-owned.
Tyler Hojo â Sidoti & Company
Okay great. And I was hoping that maybe you could comment a little bit just in regards to the work stoppage in the Miami Landing Gear facility. Maybe if you can quantify what the impact in the quarter was and how maybe that is going to impact any potential sequential uptick in business in the fourth quarter.
David Storch
Tyler, we think that the impact on revenue was between $3 million and $3.5 million. We expect to have that flow through relatively quickly. The rework thatâs being done is in process. So I think weâll be through the bulk of that in Q4 and in Q1. We think that the margin and the operating income impact is about $1 million from â that came out of the third quarter that will go into Q4 and Q1.
Tyler Hojo â Sidoti & Company
Okay. And I guess just based on some of your prepared comments there I mean is it safe to say that you really donât have a whole lot of visibility and I guess just using Indy as an example with the seven to eight days just in regards to that capacity going up or staying stable or going down, I mean is still visibility just not very good in order to maybe comment further there?
Tim Romenesko
No, I think we have fairly decent visibility. I mean we feel very good about our relationship with the customer we have today. And obviously weâve been working diligently of late to replace the business that disappears as a result of grounding. And we have some stuff that we are working on that we â we feel our capture rate â we have confidence in our ability to capture some of the stuff that we are looking at.

Tyler Hojo â Sidoti & Company
Okay.
Tim Romenesko
We would anticipate that Indianapolis a year from now will be in stronger position than it is today.
Tyler Hojo â Sidoti & Company
Alight. And the work with Southwest, the expectation was that going to go up in the fourth quarter. Is that correct?
Tim Romenesko
I donât know that for sure. I think there is changes in Southwest re-planning as well. So I wouldnât count on that.
Tyler Hojo â Sidoti & Company
Okay. Alright great. Thanks very much.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from Eric Hugel of Stephens Inc. Your line is open.
Eric Hugel â Stephens Inc.
Hey, good morning guys.
David Storch
Eric, good morning.
Eric Hugel â Stephens Inc.
Can you comment â I mean, I guess one of the key buzzwords that weâve been hearing from a lot of your I guess fellow aftermarket peers has been even over and above sort of the weak traffic numbers weâve been seeing, sort of trends of airline de-stocking. But those trends donât seem to â they only last a couple of quarters. Can you talk to us about where you think we are in that cycle and sort of â it is maybe February and March improving, maybe a sign that we are close to the end of sort of these de-stocking?
David Storch
I think itâs hard to predict, Eric, only as it relates to â try and understand whatâs happening to the fleets. I think if the fleet stabilize you are probably correct, but if the fleets continue to come down a little bit then you could have more of that effect going forward. But our sense is that if you track the business on a weekly basis, obviously, which we are doing, the business is showing some strength. So, there demand seems to be stabilizing if you will, possibly increasing slightly.
Eric Hugel â Stephens Inc.
Okay.
Tim Romenesko
We clearly had a low back in December and weâve seen some pickup since then.
Eric Hugel â Stephens Inc.
Okay great. With regards to â I guess you recently, I guess maybe a couple of months back, there was a big award that you guys won, I guess it was make tactical shelters for the FMTV, but I guess was supposed to start up this in the third quarter and I guess ramp to maybe full by the fourth quarter. Is that sort of on track, is that how we should be thinking about it?
David Storch
It is on track. It is on track, Eric, and it is.
Eric Hugel â Stephens Inc.
Okay. Are there any other big sort of programs? You referred to a couple of them because I mean your defense numbers looked really strong.
David Storch
You know, the numbers are strong. The performance, particularly at the mobility systems business is strong. Weâre continuing to add to the â win new business at least and we are doing a good job delivering against our backlog.
Eric Hugel â Stephens Inc.
Can you talk about the sustainability of that kind of growth of maybe high-single digit growth? Is that sustainable or is like maybe the revenue level is sustainable?
David Storch
No, I think there is going to be at least a modest uptick in revenue and the outlook continues to be good through our early fiscal 2011. So, we are encouraged.
Eric Hugel â Stephens Inc.
Can you comment on defense side also on the performance based logistics opportunities you are seeing out there?
David Storch
There is opportunities that we are working. Clearly, we are continuing to execute well on the programs that we have and we are looking to add to them.
Eric Hugel â Stephens Inc.
But nothing that we would â nothing material that you would prefer to think is in relative near term, just sort of just general environment?
David Storch
Right.
Eric Hugel â Stephens Inc.
Okay. Thanks a lot guys. I get back into the queue.
Operator
Thank you, sir. Our next question is from Jim Okshow [ph] of ABH [ph]. Sir, your line is open.
Jim Okshow â ABH
Good morning, gentlemen. I got a couple of questions relating to the aircraft leasing, both the planes you outright and the joint venture. First of all, do you have any leases that are expiring this year?

David Storch
We had a lease, as we indicated, that expires this quarter. The aircraft comes off lease in May. And the aircraft is attractively priced. Itâs wholly owned by the Company and the aircraft will go into disassembly where we have demand for the parts for those â for that aircraft. We have â other than that, I donât believe we have any other aircrafts that come due this fiscal year or this calendarâ-
Tim Romenesko
Just the one. We do have some âlater in the calendar year.
Jim Okshow â ABH
How many later in the year, in the calendar year?
Tim Romenesko
For the full fiscal year â10, we have â itâs either six or seven repricing. They donât start until Q2 and they are spread out to the balance of the year. So, I am just going to (inaudible) my head here, but itâs somewhere in the three to four range probably.
Jim Okshow â ABH
You just said repricing, what does that mean?
Tim Romenesko
Meaning leases coming to term.
Jim Okshow â ABH
Okay, okay. Could you give a breakdown of what kind of aircraft you have in the fleet, I mean how many â I donât know if you want to go plane-by-plane, but how many are new generation and how many narrow bodies and how many wide bodies?
David Storch
We have three wide bodies. We have two 767-300s on lease long term with United. And we have one 747-400 on lease with Northwest-Delta. We then have two A320s on lease and we â I am sorry, we have three A320s on lease. And then we have â the balance of the fleet would be 737s 300s and 400s and one 737-500.
Jim Okshow â ABH
Okay. The â just final questions and put together. First of all, do you anticipate particularly with the 737s any need for any writedowns and in light of what you said about deemphasizing this business, are you planning to offer any of these planes â any of the planes in the fleet for sale?
David Storch
Well, we do have â a couple of the airplanes are offered for sale, but at this moment we think we have a good position in the aircraft. And we are deemphasizing because the capital markets are not extremely bullish in this kind of activity. So, we are not â we donât see the same opportunities. There is a huge spread between what buyers want to pay and what sellers think the assets are worth and we see that continuing for a period of time.
Jim Okshow â ABH
Okay. So, when you say deemphasize, does that mean just that you are not going to be looking to add more planes or (inaudible) act at looking at get out of this business and sell what you have?
David Storch
Well, I think clearly on the front-end, where we havenât added an aircraft into our portfolio since Novemberâ07, so I think that the facts speak for themselves in that regard in terms of adding. And in terms of selling we have sold â we have been a seller of these aircrafts since then. We continue to operate the leases and look for opportunities to sell the assets. So that would be the way I would characterize it.
Jim Okshow â ABH
Thank you very much.
David Storch
Yes.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from Tom Louis [ph] of (inaudible). Your line is open.
Tom Louis
Yes, good morning.
David Storch
Hi Tom.
Tom Louis
I was hoping for a little clarification on â you are clearly, you are enjoying a nice â some nice growth in your mobility business. Can you talk a little bit about the extent to which this might be due to capabilities youâve added in the last few years as opposed to just the governmentâs need to protect its presence? Also, can you talk about the â what sort of visibility you might have against the day that this is not going to be a source of growth anymore and about your alternative uses for these capabilities or your ability to otherwise manage those assets at reduced volumes.
David Storch
Well, the first part of your question, Tom, is weâve expanded our product line quite dramatically. We made the acquisition of Brown Engineering a couple of years back and â a year and a half back or so, and Brown Engineering gets us into the command and communications world and environment. We think that world continues to show opportunities going forward. We feel good about the breadth of the product line today versus where it was in the past. We have capability â we are now â have these mobile shelters that â going on the back of the trucks and things of that nature. We are getting a lot better at stuffing the shelters than we were in the past. So, yes, I think the product line is definitely broader than it was in the past.

And I think as it relates to moving forward, as I said in my opening comments, we feel very good about the balance to our portfolio that we have today and historically when the commercial airline business has been a little softer that business has been a little stronger and vice versa to some extent as well. So, I think that the story is around how we are fairing through this downturn versus how we faired through previous downturns, which youâve been with us through. And I think that this â I think we are in a good position in that business. I donât see world tensions diminishing in an appreciable fashion. They may move from theater to theater, but clearly the U.S.â capability of moving into different theaters becomes more pressing and â one theater thatâs developing, quite frankly, for the Company is the Southwest United States. And so there is I think broad range of applications for our product today as the product continues to broaden itself.
Tom Louis
So, maybe moving to Texas wasnât such good idea. Okay. Now, with respect to the Aircraft Sales and Leasing, is there anything in this year your willingness to â or your decision to talking to deemphasizing, I mean youâve got â clearly, where we are cyclically speaking and the state of the â present state of the capital markets, but if we think of this business compared to maybe the way we would have perceived it five of ten years ago, is there more to it than that or is it those two factors?
David Storch
I think itâs also resource allocation for AAR. We see greater opportunities else where. And we feel really good about our positions in the other three markets. And this market â weâve always been just a dabbler in that market and I think itâs time for us at least to dabble a little bit less.
Tom Louis
Okay. And just one last question kind of under the vein of resource allocation. You had the opportunity during the quarter to buy back some of your converts. It was real obviously early in the quarter prior to the end of the last calendar year that there were a lot of motivated sellers among the holders of various convertible bonds out there. My sense is itâs a lot less so, but do you still see an opportunity to meet with a motivated potential â with motivated sellers on this part of managing your capital structure.
David Storch
Yes, Tom, from time to time we are getting phone calls from capital market folks who were representing people who have bonds that they would like to liquefy. So that has not â that has not diminished. And I can't really tell you what thatâs going to look like 90 days from now, but as we sit here today they are still â those opportunities still do exist for the Company.
Tom Louis
Okay great. Thanks a lot guys.
David Storch
Yes.
Operator
Yes, thank you, sir. Our next question or comment is from Jon Braatz of Kansas City Capital. Your line is open.
Jon Braatz â Kansas City Capital
Good morning gentlemen.
David Storch
Good morning.
Jon Braatz â Kansas City Capital
When we look at the MRO facility in Indianapolis, did we see the full brunt of the slowdown in the loss of FedEx and United Airlines in the quarter or did that get progressively worse as the quarter progressed?
David Storch
No, you saw the full brunt within the quarter.
Jon Braatz â Kansas City Capital
Okay alright. And then secondly, during the year we saw there were a couple of FAA issues, Landing Gear and on the Boeing plant I think it was, is there anything you can do to I guess I donât want to â and I donât want to assign blame or anything like that â to be somewhat more proactive or work with the FAA more quickly so that these things donât get out into the public view because that will cause a little bit of a investor anxiety? But is there anything that can be done in a private manner so that these things are resolved, letâs say, more quickly?

David Storch
Absolutely. We could have done a better job here. And we have a lesson learned, if you will, a tough lesson, a hard lesson. And shame on us to some extent. But, yes, definitely we are much more cognizant. It was an unfortunate wake up call in this context. But keep in mind now, safety of flight was never an issue, quality was never an issue, more about relationship management more than anything else. And, yes, we can do a better job in the relationship management. And I have â since this even, I have held meetings with the senior people from the flight safety and flight standards group within the FAA in Washington, D.C., and I will be meeting on a one-on-one basis with the head of the Miami (inaudible) on April 6. So, yes, clearly, we could have been â done a better job at the front end here.
Jon Braatz â Kansas City Capital
Okay, David, is it true, is my understanding correct that letâs say an FAA inspector in Oklahoma could have a different interpretation of the rules of an FAA inspector in Miami? Is it â?
David Storch
I donât know. I won't necessarily characterize it that way, but I would say that the local SIFDOs [ph] are powerful in and of themselves and need to be reckoned with in their â in the â on the locale in which they are operating. But, yes, I mean in this case here weâve been in the Miami operation now since late 80s. Weâve had relationship where we let the relationships â my interpretation is that we let the relationship get away from us. And we have to do a better job on the front-end in that relationship aspect.
Jon Braatz â Kansas City Capital
Okay. Alright. Thank you.
David Storch
Yes. But you should know also that the FAA holds the Company in very high regard, and that was conveyed to me when I was in D.C., and like I said â I just want to reiterate it, this was never a safety of flight issue, never a quality issue. And as you can tell, the parts have not been recalled or anything of that nature. So â okay.
Jon Braatz â Kansas City Capital
I understand. Thank you.
David Storch
Okay. Alright.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from JB Groh of DA Davidson. Your line is open.
JB Groh â DA Davidson & Co.
Good morning guys. Just a couple clarification questions on the margins. On the Structures the margin came down a little bit sequentially, is that just a mix issue or â what â remind me why it was so strong last quarter and dropped a little bit this quarter.
Tim Romenesko
I think if you looked historically, JB, youâd see that this quarterâs performance is sort of more in line with what you would you have â what would youâve seen as trend line â weâve been fractioning [ph] up the margin in this area, but somewhere in the 15% [ph] or just under is more in line with what youâve seen historically. So, last quarterâs was a little bit of an aberration. And it was product mix or anything.
JB Groh â DA Davidson & Co.
Okay. And then on the Aircraft Sales and Leasing (inaudible) that looks kind of strange, is that due to the parting out of the aircraft or what makes that number look a little odd?
Tim Romenesko
Sorry, which number â?
JB Groh â DA Davidson & Co.
In the Aircraft Sales and Leasing â?
Tim Romenesko
Gross profit or â?
JB Groh â DA Davidson & Co.
Yes, gross â I mean it shows up, itâs like a 50% gross profit margin. I am just guessing that has something to do with parting out the aircraft or â?
Tim Romenesko
Yes, itâs really just â itâs just least revenue. That tends to be a very high margin area when you have very little revenue. So, in the past, if you look back, when we sell an aircraft from our own portfolio, you have more sales and then you sort to actually have a slightly lower margin. But the lease revenue on â which doesnât show up as a â it tends to be a very high margin area, J. B., so I think itâs just a kind of a (inaudible) small number soâ

JB Groh â DA Davidson & Co.
Okay. Okay. Okay. And then I donât know, I am not sure if you gave a depreciation and amortization number for the quarter.
Rick Poulton
We gave some (inaudible) itâs $9.7 million for the quarter.
JB Groh â DA Davidson & Co.
Okay. Thanks a lot. Thatâs all I have.
Operator
Thank you, sir. Our next question or comment is from Henry Kennedy [ph] of Overhaul and Maintenance [ph]. Your line is open.
Henry Kennedy â Overhaul and Maintenance
Hi good morning. You mentioned before that your long term strategy includes growth, internal growth and acquisitions. Could you speak a little bit about what kind of acquisitions you might at least be interested in over the next year, where they might be or are you looking at anything in commercial overhaul or you are trying to sort of balance your portfolio away from commercial overhaul?
Henry Kennedy â Overhaul and Maintenance:
Tim Romenesko
Henry, the comment, you know â just to be clear â the comment upfront was that we had made acquisitions and investments and targeted some of our organic growth in a (inaudible) enterprise. So, going backwards, there was an effort to get more defense exposure, little more front-end content exposure and thatâs where we had been emphasizing. As we look ahead, we continue to see organic investment opportunities as well as acquisition opportunities, are all ways of â for us of using some of the cash we generate. I donât know that we have a specific priority right now, but we are interested in serving both major customer segments and we are interested in continuing to serve them both with front-end content as well as aftermarket services. So, I think all of the above are in solutions for us.
Henry Kennedy â Overhaul and Maintenance
Okay. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question or comment is from Rick [ph] of Columbia Management. Your line is open.
Rick â Columbia Management
Yes, just a follow-up on the Landing Gear shutdown. Has there â can you characterize the customer response once you were back up running, I guess, only five days later, has there been any kind of backlash or negative response.
Tim Romenesko
No. I would say there was concern obviously around the disruption as we were going through it, but we tried to keep the customers as current as we could in terms of what was happening. Since itâs been resolved, weâve been visited by all of our customers, basically. And I would say that there is no backlash, if you will, in terms of gear coming into the facility for repair.
Rick â Columbia Management
So, you donât expect to lose any material business from that event?
Tim Romenesko
Thatâs right. And we are working hard to make sure that that doesnât happen.
Rick â Columbia Management
Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question or comment is from Larry Solow of CJS Securities. Your line is open.
Larry Solow â CJS Securities
Just a follow-up to Rickâs comments and I believe someone else asked about Southwest, if I am not mistaken, did Southwest recently actually expand their relationship on â with your Landing Gear Services?
Tim Romenesko
We do Landing Gear for Southwest, yes?
Larry Solow â CJS Securities
Well, didnât they â I think I read in one of the aviation magazines, they actually increased their exposure I mean or their â I guess their planned volume in you facility, is that incorrect or â?
Tim Romenesko
No, I am sure that thatâs correct.
Larry Solow â CJS Securities
Okay. Just one question on SG&A. It seems like if you strip out the severance and (inaudible) thatâs flat on a year-over-year basis, is that a kind of a good way to look at it going forward or  â?
Rick Poulton
In absolute dollars, Larry, thatâs â you are correct in your assessment and â yes, I mean we are very focused on managing SG&A, very focused given the environment.

Larry Solow â CJS Securities
Okay. And then just last question. Any color â how about the other â the MRO facilities at Oklahoma doing and (inaudible)?
David Storch
They are both busy.
Larry Solow â CJS Securities
Okay. Thatâs good. Okay good. Thanks.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question or comment is from Stan Mann [ph] of Mann Family Investment [ph]. Your line is open.
Stan Mann â Mann Family Investment
Good morning gentlemen. I have a question on, one, on use of cash. You did comment that you â possibly on acquisitions, et cetera. In this current market with financing not available, would you say the use of cash would be more for buying and converts and maybe paying down debt, et cetera? So, could you comment on your â the way you view use of cash in this environment?
David Storch
Stan, first of all, hello.
Stan Mann â Mann Family Investment
Hello.
David Storch
Been a while. Okay, good morning. You know, I think itâs around balance. Itâs clearly looking for â our first use of cash is â itâs all around yield and return on capital, so wherever we feel we can get the best return for our capital. Right now, if you look at the (inaudible) we felt very good about putting some capital to work, taking advantage of some buying opportunities. And we put some capital to work on investment in longer lived assets. We, for instance, acquired a ship set, a 777 landing gear for approximately $8 million from Delta Airlines and secured a multi-year contract from them as a result of putting that capital to work.
We also acquired some bonds that we felt were attractively priced. As you can see, we have a 9% yield. Our cost of incremental capital is â or incremental dollars is â itâs a real positive arbitrage for us, let me put it that way. So, yes, I think itâs a balance. You know, we are constantly looking for ways to maximize the dollars that we put to work.
Stan Mann â Mann Family Investment
Well, what I was getting at it itâs less likely that weâll see a large acquisition as we had seen in the past couple of years in the current environment thatâs all I was asking.
David Storch
Yes, I would say that if we were to do an acquisition, it would be obviously accretive, first of all. Secondly, I think weâd be looking for a way to finance it that would be appropriate. But at this moment, we have a couple of minor situations that we are looking at in the overall scheme of things and, yes, so I think the opportunity would have to be a good opportunity that made sense for our portfolio.
Stan Mann â Mann Family Investment
Okay. Second question on operating margin, it slipped, obviously. So, if you put back some of the non-recurring severance, et cetera, do you still see your near term goals above 10% operating margin?
David Storch
Yes.
Stan Mann â Mann Family Investment
Seems like we reached pretty close in this quarter to back things thenâ
David Storch
Yes, yes correct.
Stan Mann â Mann Family Investment
So, youâ
David Storch
And itâs hard, but yes that â
Stan Mann â Mann Family Investment
Yes.
David Storch
Keep in mind, also, a piece of the strategy to get the margins from 10% to 12.5% for instance is around the Aircraft Sales and Leasing portfolio. So, we are going to be diminishing that. And that will add a â create a little bit more pressure on bringing the margins up in the short term.
Stan Mann â Mann Family Investment
In the short term. Well you still have moved up operating profit dollars tremendously in the last three, four years. So â
David Storch
Thatâs â
Stan Mann â Mann Family Investment
Itâs a really different ball game.
David Storch
Yes, thatâs correct.
Stan Mann â Mann Family Investment
Anyway, I think itâs a good job in this environment. Thank you.
David Storch
Thank you very much.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question or comment is from Eric Hugel of Stephens Inc. Your line is open.

Eric Hugel â Stephens Inc.
Hey guys, just a couple of follow-ups. The MRO segment, I guess, 2.9% growth year-over-year, but you had the Avborne acquisition in there. What was the organic growth or what was Avborne round about?
Rick Poulton
Avborne â weâve talked in the past about the size of Avborne, and so just to reiterate that, thatâs somewhere between $10 million and $15 million per quarter, okay? So, I won't get anymore specific than that but you can kind of play around with the numbers based on that information.
Eric Hugel â Stephens Inc.
Alright. So the organic growth in that business was something like maybe 10% to 13%, 10% to 15% or something like that and that would have been impacted by the MRO (inaudible) by the landing gear [ph]. Okay.
Second, can you talk about the Aviation Supply Chain, one of the impacts â and I just trying to sort of work my brain through â I mean you talked about the FX impact. Is that FX impact more sort of just visual in terms of your having lower sales, but higher operating income or is there no net impact or are there real sort of EPS impacts there?
Rick Poulton
The EPS impact would be much more modest, so thatâs why we are not really talking about it in EPS level. We have a pretty good natural hedge to the operation. But on the top line you see the impact.
Eric Hugel â Stephens Inc.
Can you talk about how much the top line impact was with regards to FX?
Rick Poulton
It was in the neighborhood of a couple of million dollars, Eric.
Eric Hugel â Stephens Inc.
Okay. What was CapEx in the quarter?
Rick Poulton
Just under $7 million â $6.8 million.
Eric Hugel â Stephens Inc.
Can you give us an update on how things are going with regards to the ramp up on the new composites expansion as well as how things are going with Summa, I know there are some headwinds there with regards to Gulfstream.
Tim Romenesko
On composites, the Sacramento facility is up and running. The â looking for â looking some more work, but nonetheless operating. In terms of Summa, the volumes continue to be strong there. We are looking â I am actually going to be visiting there this afternoon. We are encouraged by some of the prospects we have down there. We do have some work to do on some particular programs. But weâll work on those, weâll work through them.
So, I think on balance, I think we feel good about whatâs going on down at Summa.
Eric Hugel â Stephens Inc.
Okay. Can you give us â maybe a round a ballpark figure as to sort of this new composites facility? I mean is it sort of delivering meaningful additional contribution or is this still just pretty small right now.
Tim Romenesko
No, itâs still small, but itâs â it positions us very nicely as the â as demand for composite materials increases. So, itâs a great facility with tremendous capability that puts us in a nice place in a market that we see as really taking off here in the next three to five years.
Eric Hugel â Stephens Inc.
And your goal is still over that time period what you said $80 million to $90 million of sales?
David Storch
Well, we are looking at for the âthe composite business in total is $100 million for the two businesses.
Eric Hugel â Stephens Inc.
Okay.
David Storch
We are doing today roughly what $35 million â approximately $35 million today, we are looking to get to $100 million in five years. Thatâs in our plan. Now, we have two â if you look at the operation now in Sacramento, we have two very large defense oriented contracts that are being worked at this â at this time. And too hard to handicap whether weâll be successful or not, but if we are, weâll get to that target quicker, sooner rather than later.
Eric Hugel â Stephens Inc.
Great. Thatâs perfect. Thanks a lot guys.

Thank you, sir. Our next follow-up is from JB Groh of DA Davidson. Your line is open.
JB Groh â DA Davidson & Co.
Yes, one more question. Just on inventory, is there a way to look at that in terms of ageing and quality in light of all these retirements that we are seeing, is there a way you can sort of give us a framework to think about that?
Rick Poulton
Yes, I mean J.B., we monitor that closely by looking at turns data and we also do look at ageing data for our inventory. And our â we havenât seen any fall back in our major metrics there. And so in particular ageing more than about 85% of the inventory balance has been acquired within the â is less than 18 months. And so we feel pretty good about our carrying values in that product.

I'd like to start with some of the major financial highlights. Consolidated sales in the quarter were $520 million, which is down slightly 2.6% compared to the prior year. Similar to our second quarter, we saw continued positive trends in the commercial aftermarket and solid performance at Airlift, offset by reduced sales at our Mobility Products unit.
Consolidated operating margins in the quarter were 7.2%, which compares favorably to last year's margin of 6.7%. We expect to continue to drive margin improvement in the fourth quarter. Earnings per share in the third quarter were $0.46, which compares favorably with last year's result of $0.41 when you adjust for the tax benefit of $0.09 that was recorded last year during the third quarter.
We generated strong cash flow in the quarter and continued use of cash to reduce debt and provide value to our shareholders. Since the end of February last year, we reduced net debt by $86 million, saving approximately $7 million in annualized interest cost. Also since last February, we've purchased 620,000 shares of our stock on the open market for $8.4 million and have paid $12 million in dividends.
The number of shares used in the diluted earnings per share calculation will be 3.1 million shares lower, as a result of the third quarter convertible bond repurchase. We estimate the year-end diluted share count to be 38.6 million shares compared to 42.6 million shares in the fourth quarter of last year.
With regard to our operating environment, our global commercial business continues to benefit from a generally healthy airline industry and to a lesser degree, a strong OEM build cycle. Further, there are a number of beneficial dynamics that are playing to our competitive strengths, mostly there's a clear continuation of the trend towards outsourcing. As customers seek a more comprehensive solution, which drives them to larger, better capitalized, more diversified service providers like AAR.

We have experienced navigating the defense cycle both up and down. Flexibility is key and we are confident that we can make the necessary changes to the business to achieve acceptable returns. We will continue to manage our exposure to operational tempo in our portfolio and remain well positioned to capture the opportunities as they exist in the market, even during a downturn.
Now I would like to provide some comments around specific segment performance. Within our Aviation Services segment, the strong commercial aftermarket advances our airframe maintenance and parts support businesses. Each is performing well and continues to demonstrate an ability to grow.
We've been successful in growing our MRO profitability, as each of our established facilities is operating close to capacity and Duluth is ramping up. Demand remains high. Our efficiency and quality levels are good and our customers continue to be happy with our cost savings value proposition. We believe this is the right formula to continue to build market share, create scale and further improve on our margins.
Our strategy across our commercial air freight services business is to build on the strong relationships we have with the airlines and leasing companies by doing higher quality work faster and with deep attention to detail and a greater level of efficiency and our customers can do for themselves or their competitors can offer. We believe that this value-added position also creates an opportunity to build our services business with the U.S. government, as they look to do more with less.
Over time, we are confident we can leverage these relationships to create additional growth both in our airframe MRO and parts support businesses. While they offer separate services, these businesses have a common customer base. We're demonstrating an excellent broad side capabilities to our customers and we believe we can win incremental business. This includes for our supply chain, some discreet higher-margin aftermarket services. One good example is our recent signing of a contract, the Medical Logistics Support, which puts us in the same logistics market with a new product offering. We focus on executing it well to demonstrate our ability to efficiently manage supply chains regardless of the category.
Our Airlift business performed well in the third quarter, meeting or exceeding all customer performance measures. This is a significant mission critical business. And I would note that funding for the contracts within this unit are coming out of the overseas contingency fund, which is not subject to sequestration. We have continued to provide superior levels of operational readiness and performance, have earned the support and trust of our customers. And we expect, longer term, we'll open other doors in new regions, new contracts and adjacent markets.
I'd like to now turn to our Technology Products segment. We're pleased with the overall performance on our Cargo Systems business. We've recently consolidated the leadership structure for these businesses and our position to take better advantage of the strong OEM build cycle. Our goal is to be the clear leader in the Cargo Systems category through a combination of innovative intellectual property, Tier 1 relationships with the OEMs and strong engineering and aftermarket support capability. We are on a number of platforms, including the Airbus A320 family, the A330, the A340 and the soon to be certified A350. On Boeing, we are working on the 747-400, 767, and the new 747-8.
On the A400M program, our customer recently accepted our first entry into service Cargo Systems, bringing that program 1 step closer to contributing to results. Our Nordics business has developed a low-age shipping container that is beginning to gain traction in the market. We recently won a meaningful order for this product that will begin shipping in our fourth quarter.

During the period, we also completed the sale of 10 737-400s to the lessee during the -- which further reduced our investment in aircraft leasing. We're now down to 4 aircraft [indiscernible] joint ventures and 2 that are wholly-owned. I'd note that while we've made a conscious decision to drive down our invested capital in this business, our mix of capabilities puts us in an excellent position to continue to target aircraft modification, remarketing and sales. Along these lines, we'll be delivering the first of the commercial derivative aircraft for the Colombian Air Force in the fourth quarter, with the second aircraft scheduled for delivery in Q1 of fiscal 2014.
Before I turn the call over to Mike, I'd like to stress, we have a leadership position in each of our core businesses to create significant organic growth opportunities and enables them to contribute to strong cash flow generation for the company. We've been able to use this cash to consistently drive value to our equity shareholders in a number of ways, including reducing our leverage.
I'll reserve a few comments for closing. I would like to now turn the call over to Mike to take a closer look at our third quarter financials.
Michael J. Sharp
Thank you, David, and good afternoon, everyone. As is customary at this time, I would like to provide more color around the financial performance of the company during the third quarter including comments around interest, cash flow, capital expenditures and capital structure. And I will be around the rest of the day to answer any questions that you may have.
Consolidated revenues for the third quarter, as David mentioned, were $520 million, which is down from last year due to the reduction in sales to the government and defense market. In the Aviation Services segment, sales increased 9% to $408 million with the increase all coming from organic growth. We saw strength at our parts support businesses driven by program activity. And as David described, each of our major airframe facilities are operating well and at high-capacity utilization. As you know, we recently opened a fifth MRO in Duluth to add 4 maintenance lines at peak capacity, or approximately 400,000 man-hours. Late in the third quarter, our customer added a second line to the facility, and we expect this facility to ramp at a measured pace over the balance of the calendar year.
The reported gross profit margin in the Aviation Services segment was 14.5%. After you adjust for the loss on inventory, the gross margin is 16.7. This compares favorably to the prior year, but down on a sequential basis, primarily due to lower MRO margins as we bring in new work. We expect our margins to improve in the fourth quarter in this segment.
Turning to the Technology Products segment. We've now lapped the timing of our Telair and Nordisk acquisitions, so their sales are included in both the current and prior years. The year-over-year decline in sales reported in this segment was due to lower sales at our Mobility Products unit, although sales at mobility were stable on a sequential basis. We also experienced a reduction in sales and earnings at our Cargo Systems businesses due to the timing of systems and spares sales, which we expect to see in the fourth quarter. Gross profit margin in the Technology Products segment was 15.4% and was unfavorably impacted by the softer results at Cargo Systems. We do expect improved gross margin performance in Q4 in this segment as well.
I'd like to provide a bit more detail on the 2 transactions discussed in this afternoon's release. Although the 2 items largely offset each other, they did impact certain reported ratios, including gross profit margin and SG&A as a percent of sales.
During the quarter, we were able to negotiate a final payment and the earn-out liability that we had established for the Airinmar acquisition. The final settlement was $9 million less than we had accrued. And accordingly, $9 million was recorded as a gain, and we recorded it as a reduction in SG&A expense. Also, we entered into a sales agreement with a buyer to acquire certain airframe inventory and entered into a separate agreement with the same buyer to market the inventory for a commission. We received $9.1 million cash in the third quarter and recorded a $9.1 million loss on inventory as a result of the transaction. We will recognize revenue from this transaction as the inventory is sold to third parties.

After you adjust for the $9 million gain on the settlement of the Airinmar earnout, SG&A as a percent of sales was 9.8%, which is up slightly with last year but in line with our overall expectations. SG&A expenses were $500,000 less than the prior year, so we're doing an effective job of controlling, and in some categories, reducing our spend. Net interest expense for the third quarter was $9.8 million, a reduction of $400,000 from last year, due to overall lower debt levels.
As David discussed, we remain very focused on generating cash and reducing our debt obligations. We target free cash flow at least equal to net income and are well ahead of that this fiscal year. During the quarter, we generated $27.5 million of cash from operations and our capital expenditures for Q3 were $4.8 million. Our year-to-date cash from operations is $87.8 million and year-to-date free cash flow is $75 million.
Net debt to capital was 41% at February 28, 2013, down from 44% a year ago. Depreciation and amortization, including amortization of stock-based compensation, was $23 million for the third quarter.
As it relates to our capital structure, in late January, certain holders of the 1 3/4 convertible notes surrendered their securities for purchase by us pursuant to the terms of the indenture. The aggregate amount surrendered by the bondholders and purchased by us was $62.8 million. In order to fund the purchase of these notes, we principally used cash on hand and free cash flow generated during Q3.
In addition to these note purchases, we entered into an exchange transaction with another holder of the 1 3/4 convertible notes, whereby the holder exchanged their $22.7 million note plus $7.3 million cash for a new $30 million note. This new note was priced to yield 3.75% and matures on February 1, 2015.
The underlying shares on the 1 3/4 convertible notes have historically been included in our share count for diluted earnings per share purposes. As a result of the convertible note transactions in the third quarter, 900,000 shares came out of the share count in Q3, an additional 2.2 million will come out in Q4. As David indicated previously, for modeling purposes, we recommend you use approximately 38.6 million shares for your fourth quarter share count.
Lastly, with respect to guidance, as you've seen, we've increased our full year guidance again this quarter. This reflects our third quarter performance and visibility that we have into Q4. We now expect fiscal 2013 diluted earnings per share in the range of $1.78 to $1.82 per share.
Thanks for your attention, and I'll now turn the call back over to David for some closing comments.
David P. Storch
Thanks, Mike, and solid report. We're pleased to have delivered another good quarter and we expect a strong finish to our fiscal year, even so we are not satisfied. We're driving hard to produce better levels of profitability across our business. And as we look at our growth opportunities, we'll focus on building out our leadership positions to make our value proposition more compelling to our customers.
So with that, I'd like to thank you for your participation. And madam operator, we're now ready to take questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Tyler Hojo from Sidoti & Company.
Tyler Hojo - Sidoti & Company, LLC
First question, just on the Airlift business. I get you have a great backlog visibility there still. And I also understand kind of the funding comes from the OCO budget, so you've got some production there. But in past quarters, you've talked to us about looking to diversify the Afghan exposure of that business. Can you perhaps talk a little bit about any progress on that front?
David P. Storch
Yes. I'd say that we're making progress. All of our assets right now are fully employed, so we're working on a strategy to have assets that can be utilized elsewhere. But, yes, suffice to say that we have some interesting paths that we're exploring at this point.

Tyler Hojo - Sidoti & Company, LLC
Okay, David. Now at what point do you need to actually see some of those contracts come in before risking kind of pretty sharp decline in that business?
David P. Storch
Well, I think we're expecting the level of activity that we're currently experiencing to continue for a period of time. So our -- the customers indicating to us at least that they don't see a softening of demand for -- through next year. So at this stage, we see that -- the pace continuing. Just to give you a sense, the number of flights and the number of hours that we're logging this December versus last December where -- is approximately 30,000 less troops, are very similar to each other, or in fact, slightly higher this year than prior year. So even with a reduction in force, it feels like that the demand is not tailing off. So I think you've heard me say this before, we don't -- we handle approximately 1,000 passengers a day. So you still have 66,000 American troops, I believe, in [indiscernible], 68,000. So our -- what we -- ideally, what we'd like is we'd like to have similar revenue opportunity -- or have similar revenue flows from other theaters. But right now, for the foreseeable future, this market continues to be relatively strong.
Tyler Hojo - Sidoti & Company, LLC
Okay. And just one last follow-on to that, can you remind us of when your big contracts there will be up for rebid, is it December?
David P. Storch
Well, I don't know about rebid, but we have a bid that comes due -- we have, I'm sorry, we have an option that comes due in May. It's a fix swing option. We've been verbally told as we have in the past that, that will be exercised. And then we have a couple of meaningful options that come due in October and November later in this calendar year.
Tyler Hojo - Sidoti & Company, LLC
Okay, great. And just one other question, if I may. Just as it pertains to the guidance, are there any planned aircraft sales in Q4? If so, could you quantify?
David P. Storch
We have that 1 aircraft sale that we've -- that I talked about in my comments, the Colombian Air Force, which will be -- we will be delivering in Q4. And then we have a similar -- a sister ship that we'll be delivering in Q1 through year '14.
Tyler Hojo - Sidoti & Company, LLC
But nothing out of any of the JVs?
David P. Storch
We have 1 situation that's being worked, too hard for me to handicap, so I wouldn't want to commit to any further aircraft activity.
Operator
And our next question comes from the line of Larry Solow from CJS Securities.
Lawrence Solow - CJS Securities, Inc.
You guys did a pretty good job explaining the gross margin issues this quarter, I was just curious, on the aviation side, if we strip out the inventory reduction or the sale of inventory, margins were still down sequentially. Was there anything else in there? Or is it just sort of -- revenue was sort of up sequentially, margin was down. Anything in there other than the inventory issue that you can call out?
Michael J. Sharp
Larry, it's Mike. What I included in my comments when I talked about Aviation Services was that we had the inventory item and then we had lower margin sequentially at our airframe maintenance facilities principally related to bring in new work in Q3.
Lawrence Solow - CJS Securities, Inc.
Okay. So just mostly -- that was in Duluth, I imagine, and that moved the needle that much?
Michael J. Sharp
Duluth, and we also ramped up from new customers in Indianapolis, Larry.
Lawrence Solow - CJS Securities, Inc.
Okay. That was sort of my next question, how are the other MRO facilities? What's the outlook there?
Michael J. Sharp
They are busy. We've taken on some new lines of work for a particular customer that we're kind of in the learning curve on. But we expect to have -- see that turn around here in Q4.

Lawrence Solow - CJS Securities, Inc.
Okay. And on the defense side. I know that the -- it looks like the Airlift businesses certainly improved executional. How about the precision on the UN business? That was also having some issues a few quarters back.
Michael J. Sharp
It's better. It's -- we've been talking about kind of sequential improvement and we've seen that. Still not where we want it, but we have a leadership team in place there that's committed to getting the business towards generating reasonable returns for us. So I would say that it's better and it continues to get better. But still not where we want it.
Lawrence Solow - CJS Securities, Inc.
Okay. And on the -- just on the -- some of the acquisitions, any -- Telair, you mentioned some of the programs you guys are in. Year-over-year, could you tell us how that did and what the outlook is for that business?
Michael J. Sharp
So what I mentioned, Larry, in my comments in Technology Products was that the Cargo Systems business had a softer Q3 principally around timing of spares and some system shipments, which we expect to get back to more normal levels in Q4.
Lawrence Solow - CJS Securities, Inc.
Okay. And by normal, is that sort of running -- is it sort of low-single digit growth? Or what is it? I know year-over-year, like -- excluding the sort of lumpy year from the timing of orders.
Michael J. Sharp
In terms of forecast for that business for Q4?
Lawrence Solow - CJS Securities, Inc.
Or just how it's -- yes, or a forecast for 4 as you look out over the next few quarters or what sort of...
Michael J. Sharp
No, no, we see a nice improvement in Q4. And Larry, we're also very pleased with -- as David mentioned with our position here. We're on great long-term programs and as the A350 comes online, we're going to be well positioned there. So the future for this business is excellent and it's performed very well since the acquisition and the performance next quarter is going to be very solid as well.
Lawrence Solow - CJS Securities, Inc.
And just if I may, just one quick -- on the reduced earn out on Airinmar, is that reflecting that it's not quite performing up to expectations? Or would that earnout have been where it would have been exceeding expectations?
Michael J. Sharp
The businesses has been performing very well for us, particularly in helping us with our internal spend on programs. So we've been pleased with the performance of the business. The earnout is a mathematical formula and it was in both parties' interest to negotiate this conclusion.
Lawrence Solow - CJS Securities, Inc.
Okay, just lastly. David talked about just macro trends and outsourcing, sort of the stars aligning. It seems like that number should continue to rise. It's been on a secular trend in the last couple of decades. Just in terms of American Air and U.S. Air consolidating. And I know American Air has not normally been a big outsourcer. Any thoughts on that and how that may impact your performance?
Michael J. Sharp
I think it's a little early, Larry. My view is that the U.S. Air team will ingest some creative thinking into the American organization, but I'd be hopeful and somewhat optimistic, but I wouldn't be, at this stage, factoring anything in. It's a little bit too early.
Operator
And our next question comes from the line of Michael Callahan from Topeka Capital Markets. And it seems that he has removed himself.
Our next question comes from the line of J. B. Groh from D.A. Davidson.
J. B. Groh - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division
Did you address sort of MRO and sort of where you are in terms of capacity utilization there? I don't know if Duluth is contributing yet or not, but could you kind of go over that?
Michael J. Sharp
Yes, we touched on it actually and Duluth is contributing. The shop there are all very busy. We are ramping up some new programs across our various facilities that have a little bit of drag on margins this quarter. We expect better margins next quarter. Duluth is, I think, been a terrific story in terms of going from a mothball plant to a plant that has 2 lines of work going today. But still, we're looking for people and we want to get the ramp to 3 and then 4 lines as quickly as possible. But the MRO business is doing well. There's good demand for our services and our performance has been balanced very good.

J. B. Groh - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division
Okay. What do you think on the acquisition front that you're -- how's that pipeline looking, what's the appetite like currently, versus what it's been in the past?
David P. Storch
There are some interesting things, J. B., so we're kind of -- we have our finger in -- out there, kind of in the mix, if you will. And I think what I'm saying is that any acquisitions we do will be to strengthen the leadership positions we have in the -- from markets we've been discussing. So anything that comes up that improves our supply chain deliverables, anything that improves our MRO capability, anything that improves our Cargo Systems, we'll be looking at those opportunities very closely.
J. B. Groh - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division
And then lastly, could you talk about sort of what you think? You guys have a sort of unique perspective on, I think, airline inventory levels? Could you talk about what you're seeing there in terms of burned down, or rebuild, or steady-state?
David P. Storch
I think the airlines are watching their inventory levels very closely. And my sense is that you're probably going through a little bit of a burn down at present. And I would imagine that, that will -- should continue for a short period, but then they'll probably get their inventory positions ready for the strong summer season they're expecting.
J. B. Groh - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division
So when do you expect that to kind of bottom?
David P. Storch
Say that again?
J. B. Groh - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division
When do you expect that to bottom, the...
David P. Storch
I think as we sit here today, it's probably bottomed.
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And we have Michael Callahan, again, from Topeka Capital Markets.
Michael Callahan - Topeka Capital Markets Inc., Research Division
So I apologize if this was asked while I was signing back in here, but I don't know about the structures business, did you guys give any -- or do you guys have any insight, I guess, with respect to assuming the current budget passes, or the Appropriations Bill passes the House and Senate and goes through. Does that lead you guys to believe there will be any improvement in that business? Or have orders been held back at all? Or is this just kind of the result of, I guess, the drawdown on Iraq and Afghanistan?
David P. Storch
Yes, I think it's a combination. I think we're -- the business is giving us a -- continues to give us a good return on capital and the business continues to operate efficiently. I believe that the requirements are down as a result of both factors you indicated. And we were planning on those requirements staying down for a period of time. So as we look at Q4 for instance, we don't see any major changes. You might have slightly up, slightly down, but nothing -- no significant directional changes. And as we enter the new fiscal year, I think we're looking at relatively flat to where we are today. So we've been in this situation before with this business. We're a little bit, I think, stronger this cycle than we've been other cycles. So I would anticipate there will be a tough slide for this business for a period of time.
Michael Callahan - Topeka Capital Markets Inc., Research Division
Okay. That was helpful. Maybe one last one here, just as far as the aftermarket trends what you're seeing throughout the quarter, it seems like you guys reported a little bit stronger of a quarter maybe than the guys who finished at a normal calendar year for this kind of same time period. So did you see strengthening, as the quarter progressed? Or -- and how did things look towards the end? Or can you give any color there?
David P. Storch
I think it was fairly consistent throughout. I can't say that we saw any change. Keep in mind now, our -- this quarter is a low quarter to begin with, because you're dealing with the December, January and February period. So December is typically soft, due to the holidays. And February's soft, because it only has 28 days. So historically, this has been our softest quarter. Now that said, we had nice growth over prior year and I think a lot of that is due to some of the stuff that we've been talking about in terms of our positioning and our customer interaction and our performance. So I think as we look out into Q4, I think if you look at our commercial growth rates, versus many of our people also selling to the commercial markets over the last 3 or 4 years, I think you'll see that we've given a pretty good accounting for ourselves. So I would anticipate that, that will continue.

Operator
And we have no further questions at this time.
David P. Storch

Good day, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the AAR Corp. Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2013 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference call Mr. Chris Mason, Director of Corporate Communications. You may begin, sir.
Chris Mason
Thank you, Kevin. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to AAR's fiscal 2013 fourth quarter and year end earnings call. Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that comments made during the call may include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as noted in our news release and the Risk Factors section of the company's Form 10-K for fiscal year ended May 31, 2012. In providing forward-looking statements, the company assumes no obligation to provide updates to reflect future circumstances or anticipated or unanticipated events. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to AAR's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, David Storch.
David P. Storch
Thank you, Chris, and good afternoon. Thank you for joining us today to discuss what has been an excellent year for AAR. I'm joined in our boardroom by Tim Romenesko, our Chief Operating Officer; and Mike Sharp, our acting Chief Financial Officer.
I am also very pleased to have our incoming Chief Financial Officer, John Fortson in the room with us here today. As you know, John joins us from Merrill Lynch, where he was the head of the bank's Global Capital Goods sector. Over the years, John interacted with the company over the last nine years and has a good familiarization with the business and the company and the challenges and the opportunities. And we're very excited to have John join our team. I'd also like to note that in terms of leadership experience, prior to his finance career, John was a company commander in the 82nd Airborne and is a West Point graduate. We're excited to the strength and experience he brings to our team. And John will assume the CFO responsibilities effective tomorrow.
I'd also like to thank Mike Sharp for the job he did, acting as CFO over the past 10 years. Mike has been with the company for quite some time and will continue on with the company as our Vice President, Chief Accounting Officer and Controller.
So moving along, here are some of the highlights from the quarter. Sales were $554 million. This solid performance was driven by continued strength in our commercial aviation businesses, including our MRO operations and Telair. Further, although we saw defense-related softness in certain areas, we continue to see strong results from our Airlift business, even with no additional aircraft or contracts being added during the year.
Operating income in the quarter adjusted for a charge on the KC-10 program that Mike will give you more details about in a few minutes, grew to $39 million. And adjusted net earnings for the quarter was $0.50 per share, up nicely compared to $0.45 per share last year. And for the full year, sales were $2.14 billion, an increase of 3.5%. We grew adjusted operating income by 5.9% to $152.4 million and we reported adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.85. As we look back at the year, it's important to point out that we also generated $125 million of free cash flow, allowing us to reduce our net debt position by $91 million. We retired the 1.75% convertible notes, which also reduced the number of shares used in our diluted share count by 3.4 million shares. We bought back nearly 1 million shares of common stock in average price of $14.90. We paid out $0.30 per share in dividend. And we also refinanced the portion of our revolver debt, locking in at a low interest rate.

As you can see, we are working to pull all of the appropriate levers that create value for our shareholders. We're pleased with what we accomplished, both in the quarter and in the year.
So if I may, Aviation Services, our segments performed well in the fourth quarter with sales up 7% versus prior year. I want to recognize -- I want to take a moment if I could and recognize the incredible work that our employees at our Airlift business are doing on the ground and in the air in Afghanistan and other locations. This is not easy work and these teammates are performing brilliantly. They have demonstrated exceptional levels of reliability and performance. Airlift revenues grew by 28% this year, strictly due to outstanding operational performance and high levels of readiness.
We were pleased that the U.S. transportation command awarded as an option year, expense of $98 million for our fixed wing aircraft. This covers a meaningful portion of our revenue expectation for the year ahead, and in general, demand remains strong.
We remain confident that our operational readiness will continue at high levels in the coming year. When we bought this business in 2010, we saw a long-term demand for this type of capability. Early on, we faced certain challenges transitioning the business. And over the past year, we made great progress exceeding our operational plan and positioning the company for the future. In MRO, I'd like to share with you that we had very strong fourth quarter, an excellent year, and this continues to be a growth business for the company. To update you on our operations, we have facilities in Indianapolis, Miami, Oklahoma City and Hot Springs. And in this fiscal year, we added Duluth. We delivered close to five million man-hours of work this year, which in essence is showing steady growth over our prior year. We continue driving efficiencies on our operations. And as a result, we are seeing improvements in margins. We have a strong position in the U.S. domestic narrow-body market, and now we are looking for opportunities to serve the wide-body market as well as to see if we can grow our footprint internationally. Very pleased with the progress we've made operationally. We've caught the notice of people, not just here in the States, but also around the globe, and this is creating opportunities for the company that in the past we didn't necessarily see. Our commercial supply chain management park support business had a solid quarter. We see steady demand for our products on the commercial side, and our view is that spares market remains fundamentally healthy and is expected to pick up over the next several months. And as many of you know, who have been following the company for quite some time, we have a really good leadership position in this market. And our view is that there's tremendous opportunities for us to go ahead and pivot off of our current position and see steady growth and some really exciting stuff happening in that business over the next year in front of us.
We did see some weakness on our Defense Logistics business, largely due to the falloff in activity in the KC-10 program. Mike will give you the details, but as a result of adjusting our forecast to reflect lower flying activity, we incurred a $19.5 million after-tax charge in the quarter.
Flight hours on the KC-10 program have been at historically low levels. We are, however, continuing to seek ways to improve the economics of this program. In the fourth quarter we delivered one of two specially-modified aircraft to the Colombian Air Force, that we discussed during our last call. The second aircraft has been delivered in the first quarter of fiscal 2014. This project is a great example of a complex undertaking that brought us together over eight different teams within AAR and is representative of our unique and integrated capabilities. As an additional piece of good news, we announced yesterday an award to deliver two customized 737 aircrafts to the U.S. Marshals Service. In both these instances, these were aircraft that we went on to the market procured, we managed the aircraft through overhauls and conversions, and we manage the engine overhauls, landing gear overhauls, et cetera. So I think it's a good example of the capability that AAR has, and in both regards these are defense and government related customers looking for lower-cost solutions.

In Technology Products, we've had good results. We continue to see good results from the acquisition of Telair and Nordisk. And of course those gives us a lot more exposure in this sector towards the commercial markets. But overall, this past year has been a challenging one, given the pressure on defense budgets, and its impact, specifically on our mobility business. We had a significant decline in revenues as we had forecasted during this period in mobility, and yet we were able to go ahead and still have a -- I might add that even though they've had a significant reduction in revenues, they still are running a profitable business with decent margins.
Telair showed improvement and finished the year with a particularly strong quarter if we look at it on year-over-year basis. And at Nordisk, we're in the process of introducing some new products, one of which is around fire contamination and elimination with a venture that we have with our partner, DuPont.
In closing, as we move along our new fiscal year, we will continue to focus on execution. We'll look for ways to grow our business, to improve our margins, and we'll remain focused on cash generation, something that we're very proud of as you review this year's results. And the goal is to provide superior products and services to our clients and to deliver overall value to our shareholders. So with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Mike and fill you in on some of the financial details.
Michael Sharp
Okay, thanks, David. I will now provide a bit more color around the financial performance of the company during the fourth quarter, including comments around interest, cash flow, capital expenditures and capital structure. John and I will both be available the rest of the day to answer any questions that you may have.
As David mentioned, revenues in the fourth quarter were $554 million versus the prior-year level of $563 million. Aviation Services revenue grew 7% to $417 million, driven by strong performance at Airlift and in our airframe maintenance facilities, offset slightly by lower revenues and aftermarket support for our defense customers. Our airframe maintenance facilities continue to perform well and at high-capacity utilization. Our Duluth facility is up and running with two lines, and expected to go to a third line in September.
Technology Products revenue declined 21% year-over-year to $137 million, driven largely by the expected decline in demand for mobility products, which saw a $47 million sales decline in the fourth quarter compared to the fourth quarter of last year. This was positively offset by strength, as David mentioned, in Commercial Cargo systems, which rebounded in the quarter. Consolidated gross profit margin in the fourth quarter was 10.9% and includes the KC-10 related charge. As you know, we are currently in the middle of a multi-year support program, teaming with Northrop Grumman to support the Air Force's fleet of KC-10 aircraft. Our primary responsibilities include inventory management and repairs of critical components. The contract has two primary revenue streams: First, a flight hour stream for which we are paid based on hours flown; and the second revenue stream is the over and above, which is for services not covered in the flight-hour portion. Under generally accepted accounting principles, we are required to project the future profitability of the flight hour portion over the life of the program. In order to make those projections, we have to estimate future flight hours, as well as costs to support the fleet. In fiscal 2012, we reduced the profit margin on the flight hour portion of the contract from 8% to 2% due to higher-than-expected costs. As we entered fiscal 2013, in order to support the 2% margin, we established cost-saving targets to reduce spend over the life of the program. I'm pleased to report that we exceeded our first-year savings targets. However, beginning in the second half of fiscal 2013, we experienced a decrease in flight hour revenue due to lower operations tempo in what we believe were the effects of sequestration. To put this in perspective, the annualized level of flight hours in the second half of fiscal 2013 was 28% lower compared with the annualized level of flight hours in the first half of the year.

As a result of this unexpected and significant decline in flight hour revenue, together with our revised forecast for future usage of the fleet, which is below our previous forecast and below historical usage, we further lowered the revenue and profitability forecast for the flight hour portion of the contract, resulting in the $19.5 million after-tax charge during the fourth quarter.
In fiscal 2014, we will record 0% margin on the flight hour portion of the contract, which is estimated to be approximately $45 million of revenue. And for the over and above portion, we will record normal margins on approximately $35 million to $40 million in revenue.
Adjusting for this charge, the gross profit margin in the Aviation Services segment was 16.1%. As for the Technology Products segment, the gross profit margin came in at 15.1%, which was below our expectations due to our machining unit missing its targets.
Midway to the fourth quarter, we began to implement a series of initiatives to improve the performance of our machining centers, including further integration with other manufacturing centers in the Technology Products segment.
Moving on, SG&A as a percentage of sales in the fourth quarter was 9.5%, which is in line with our overall expectations. Net interest expense for the fourth quarter was $9.6 million, a reduction of $1.8 million from the prior year due to lower overall debt levels. As David mentioned, we're very focused on cash generation. During the quarter, we generated $75.1 million of cash from operations, and our CapEx was $13.7 million. Full-year cash from operations was a record $162.9 million and free cash flow was $125.3 million.
During the fourth quarter, depreciation and amortization, including amortization of stock-based compensation, was $22.5 million. As it relates to our capital structure, in late April we completed an add-on offering of $150 million principal amount of our 7.25% notes. The notes were sold at a price equal to $107.5 million of the principal amount for a yield-to-maturity of 6.1% to 8%. The net proceeds, after expenses, were approximately $158 million and were used to reduce the outstanding borrowings on our revolving credit agreement.
At May 31, there's $120 million outstanding under our revolver, compared to $280 million last year. Our net debt to capital ratio is 40.8% at May 31, 2013, compared to 45.6% last year.
We enter fiscal 2014 with 38.6 million shares in the diluted share count, which is a full 4 million shares below last year at this time. Thanks for your attention. And I will now turn the call back over to David for some closing comments.
David P. Storch
Thanks, Mike. Let me conclude with our guidance for fiscal year 2014. As stated in our press release today, we currently expect 2014 consolidated sales in the range of $2.175 billion to $2.225 billion. In Aviation Services we expect to see continued strength in our supply chain and MRO repair businesses. We also expect our Airlift business to continue to perform well as we work towards identifying and capturing additional market opportunities. In our Technology Products business, we expect to see revenue stability in the defense environment that remains under pressure. We believe our Mobility Products business, which was a major source of pressure in fiscal 2013, has leveled off. Our major initiatives in the segment are focused on operating efficiencies and innovation in lightweight solutions. Across the company, we intend to continue to drive improvement in our operating margin. As a result, we are currently guiding for a full year diluted earnings per share in the range of $2 to $2.05. Thank -- at this time, I would like to thank you for your participation and listening to our update. And we're now open for any questions you might have.

Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Larry Solow with CJS Securities.
Lawrence Solow - CJS Securities, Inc.
David, I was wondering or Tim or whoever, just can give us sort of a read on the aviation market in general sort of where your customers stand, where you think -- sort of your pulse as we stand today?
David P. Storch
Yes. We feel pretty good about commercial markets. We think we had a good year. We have a fair amount of initiatives underway. We have more visibility and opportunities than we've had in the past. So yes, I think that the commercial markets look okay.
Lawrence Solow - CJS Securities, Inc.
Sort of, things -- sort of capacity wise, and load factors, it seems like things are sort of slowly ticking up, is that fair to say?
David P. Storch
Yes. Our sense is that our customers are doing well. And that -- they're looking at a lot of different things. They're looking at a lot of -- it's a lot of moving pieces. You have the Delta taking on the Southwest aircraft, the 717. You have our building up of our people count, if you will, in Duluth, so we can handle more work up there. Yes, I -- our international business opportunity pool looks pretty strong. So I'd say, all in all, our distribution business has done well. We didn't really disclose much -- talk about Unison, but our Unison distribution business is very strong, very -- double-digit growth on a year-over-year basis. So, yes, I think we got a lot of good stuff going on. The MRO shops are full. It's pretty busy. Of course it's summer time, so they're a little less full than they've been in other parts of the year. But on a year-over-year basis, they're fairly strong. We continue to seek out engineering service opportunities, but the demand is there. There's few situations that we're competing for that we hope to win. So, yes, I'd say the feel is pretty good on the commercial side.
Lawrence Solow - CJS Securities, Inc.
Just two thoughts. The Unison deal, I think when you signed that it was supposed to ramp and inevitably reach sort of, I think, $600 million plus or minus over 10 years. Is it sort of reaching its $60 plus million potential sales?
David P. Storch
Not quite there this year. I think that we should start hitting that target this year, we're coming up to in the following year. But we do have nice progress from year one to year two. And we would expect that -- there's no reason to believe that progress won't continue into year three and on to year four.
Lawrence Solow - CJS Securities, Inc.
Could you just remind be on the Colombian Air Force, I think you probably discussed the last quarter. What's the general -- what was the impact on the P&L, and with the sale -- the deal you announced yesterday be similar?
David P. Storch
Yes. The -- so the Colombian deal was -- we took two commercial aircraft and converted one into a freighter -- full-freighter and we converted 1 into a combi, which is part freighter, part passenger. We delivered the first aircraft in Q4. It had a -- not a significant impact on earnings. It had good impact on cash because we utilized some assets that we had in stock to go on the air -- to fit on to the aircraft. And so we converted some inventory into cash, but we fell out of margins. So it was still a profitable transaction. It contributed to the quarter's results. And then, the second aircraft delivered this month -- earlier this month to the customer and had a little bit better margin than the first aircraft. And, yes, I think it was a good transaction for the company -- we've also received some follow-on business and we have a reason to believe that there may be more business opportunities to the company with the customer. They're very pleased with the product. They showcased both aircraft at their airshow on July 11 this month. And the aircraft will be on show at a Chilean airshow in March next year.

Lawrence Solow - CJS Securities, Inc.
Okay just last question, just on free cash flow, which was ridiculously good this year. I mean is that over $3 a share versus $1.80 or whatever and EPs, is that sort of -- I imagine not quite sustainable, but how should we look at that as we go out?
Michael Sharp
This is a very critical component for us, so we're working very hard. Compensation plans are tied to cash flow generation, so the business is very focused on turning lazy assets into cash, as well as generating better margins and better throughput. So hard for me to quantify precisely if we get to the same level, but I think directionally we'll be in the same ZIP code. We will not have the same kind of yo-yo effect that we've had in prior years when we've had successful cash generation. We believe this cash flow will be steady. Will it be exactly these levels, Larry? Maybe not, but they'll -- they will be solid -- you should see solid cash flow numbers coming from the company this year.
Operator
Our next question comes from J. B. Groh with DA Davidson.
J. B. Groh - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division
I had a question on your realignment of the KC-10 business. I know you've baked in $45 million at 0% margin. Is there any potential upside to that, if you can work on some costs?
David P. Storch
Yes. The upside will be in the flight hours. So we've taken our conservative look at the flight hours as a result of what we've experienced the last six months. And -- so we've forecast -- we're forecasting fairly low aircraft utilization. And our revenue from the flight hours comes through the utilization, or the number of flight hours that they operate. So we have mild in very low hours. If we get a pickup as a result of the movement of assets away from Afghanistan, or if there's a buildup in Syria or place like -- or something like that, then we would expect the business to be more profitable than the 0% that we now have baked in.
J. B. Groh - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division
But has the customer told you any reason why the flight hour numbers are down so significantly?
David P. Storch
No. The customer has not divulged because, first of all, our customer is Northrop Grumman. Northrop Grumman's customer is the Air Force. We have had indirect contact with the Air Force, but most of contact is directly through Northrop, and they do not have visibility precisely as to why or visibility as to what we should be expecting. Now what we've done is we've looked at the flight hours going back since 1998, and that's as far back as we can get records. And we have been forecasting average usage in the fleet. And we've been a little bit disappointed or surprised that the actual usage, which is at this historical low level. So we think we took a prudent action at this point in time. And if the flight hours resume to historical levels, then this will be -- this segment of the contract will be -- once again, will be profitable.
J. B. Groh - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division
Okay. And then on -- you mentioned a pretty decent results in Airlift, and it sounds like you perhaps picked up some share there. Is that correct?
David P. Storch
No. I think what we've seen is we've operated the aircraft much more efficiently than we have in the past. So you may recall, JB, when we bought this business, we felt there was about $25 million of income on the table that could be assumed once we were able to put certain disciplines in place and the keep the aircraft operationally ready. And the team, led by Randy Martin, has done a remarkable job this past year in having those aircraft in a ready position. So the growth that we've had is really -- actually with fewer aircraft in theater, we've had a significant growth in sales and in income coming from that business.

J. B. Groh - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division
So just better utilization and asset management is what you're saying?
David P. Storch
Absolutely. We've actually freed up some assets that we can possibly apply elsewhere, or if not sell.
J. B. Groh - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division
But with all the talk of the drawdown, that sort of thing, is that market still -- I mean is it growing in terms of more outsourcing and more potential bid activity?
David P. Storch
There's additional demand. Actually, as we sit here today, there's a demand that's been identified in Afghanistan. So there is an RFP that's on the street to support the Afghan nationals. So we are -- we're in there with a bid and hopefully we'll have news in the next few weeks. Other than that, we are looking for other places where we can get utilization and take some market share there -- as we've talked about before, there is a pretty broad and varied application for this kind of capability across different government entities. And it would be our intention to go ahead and compete and capture some of that business.
J. B. Groh - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division
Maybe guys, you can give us a portfolio update in terms of the owned aircraft and the ones that are in the JV.
David P. Storch
Are we talking about the aircraft leasing portfolio now?
J. B. Groh - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division
Yes, yes.
David P. Storch
Mike?
Michael Sharp
JV, there's six aircraft in total. Two of the aircraft are wholly-owned and there are four aircraft that are owned under joint venture.
David P. Storch
JB, also keep in mind now, these aircraft that we've been talking about that we traded here with U.S. Marshal service and with the Colombians, were aircraft that we did not own before we made these transactions. So these are not -- these aircraft did not come from our inventory. They were aircraft that we sourced, purchased, fixed, and then in some cases modified, and then sold.
J. B. Groh - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division
Great. And then lastly, Mike, could you maybe give us what's embedded in your 2014 outlook in terms of a tax rate and interest expense?
Michael Sharp
So for the tax rate, we're thinking in the 34% to 35% range, which is where we historically have been, notwithstanding some of the benefits that we've had from some of the state tax planning strategies we've incorporated over the last couple of years. In terms of interest, it's fairly steady with the fourth quarter interest levels.
J. B. Groh - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division
Okay, so about 9%, 6% net?
Michael Sharp
Maybe slightly higher.
Operator
Our next question comes from Jon Braatz with Kansas City Capital.
Jonathan P. Braatz - Kansas City Capital Associates
David, can you talk a little bit about the A400 program? I think the plane started flying. Do you expect any revenue from that program this year?
David P. Storch
Yes. We should have revenue. We could have revenue as early as Q1, but we will have that revenue in Q2. The program, as you said, is very -- they're very close. They have not delivered the first aircraft, which is MSN 7 to the French Air Force yet, but they are planning to do that pretty much any day now. And it should happen before this month is out actually. So, yes, we've made a lot of progress on that program.
Jonathan P. Braatz - Kansas City Capital Associates
I think the program has shrunk from the original size. And you've capitalized a lot of costs associated with that program. Is there any risk that those, that you might have to write-off some of those costs? Or how are you going to -- how is that going to be reflected in the revenues coming upstream?
David P. Storch
Yes. So as we see it now, based on the price that we have per system, we did have a renegotiation with Airbus that we completed here recently. In that renegotiation, we have identified kind of scope of work that we will now be doing, which is slightly less than the original slope -- scope. And then we have a pricing, which is very similar to the pricing we have for the full scope. We anticipate that over the life of the program, we will recover our investment through the selling price that we have. We also will have spare sales. We've had some already. We had some that went into Q4. And we anticipate additional spare sales throughout the fiscal year.

J. B. Groh - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division
Well since you capitalize a lot of these costs, I guess the cash flow from any revenue would be rather significant.
David P. Storch
Yes, that's correct. Yes, you should expect solid cash flow as we sell A400M systems correct.
Jonathan P. Braatz - Kansas City Capital Associates
Okay. On the Airlift business, how many -- how much of the portfolio is sort of booked for this year? And how many may come off contract?
David P. Storch
The fixed wing are booked all the way through. A very large percentage of fixed wing are booked all the way through May of next year, so May of '14. There are the -- the rotary wing contract, one contract expires in November and one contract is up for an option year in October. We have a high level of confidence that a large percentage of those assets, even the ones that come off contract, will be transferred over to the contract that still has option years remaining, at least that's our intel as we sit here today.
Jonathan P. Braatz - Kansas City Capital Associates
How many rotary aircraft do you have?
David P. Storch
22? There is -- I should know it, 19, 2 and 2. So 24.
Jonathan P. Braatz - Kansas City Capital Associates
24. And so only one...
David P. Storch
24 in Afghanistan, approximately, okay? We can get you the exact number.
Jonathan P. Braatz - Kansas City Capital Associates
No, that's fine. So -- but only one comes off-contract in November and there's one with an option. So basically, 22 solid?
David P. Storch
No one contract. The contracts are for multiple aircraft. We have it laid out in our 10-K, and we can get you that data here very easily, I just don't have it right at this minute.
Operator
Our next question comes from Doug Carlson with Bank of America.
Doug Carlson
If you could just give us some kind of broad color on the Middle East and kind of what the demand picture looks like there. I think you've done a great job navigating that area. A little color on that would be my first question.
David P. Storch
Well, let's see. I mean, Middle East is -- in terms of the -- we've opened up an office in Abu Dhabi to capture more commercial business in the Middle East. So where my head is kind of going in the Middle East right now is to try to figure out how we take advantage of their order book and be in a position to support their growing fleets. So that's the first thing that comes to mind when I think Middle East. Secondly, of course, is Middle East as it relates to U.S. activity. Today we do virtually no business in support of the State Department in Iraq, although there are certain opportunities to do business in support of that customer, we are not currently participating. If we think of Afghanistan as the Middle East, we have a significant presence there with our Airlift operation. Our mobility business, which in the past has supported U.S. operations in moving supplies into that, the other has been softened by the reduction in activity. And then we have recently won a contract supporting the Saudi Arabia -- an effort in Saudi Arabia, where we've -- our C4I business is providing some integration work, as is our container -- our mobility business providing some shelter. So I believe that the Middle East continues to be an area of opportunity for the company. We've invested by opening up an office, as I indicated, in Abu Dhabi. We're staffing that office with one of our senior marketing types and we've had some good success. I might add also that, that office is also handling our activities in Africa. And we have had some success, most notably in Kenya. But we're also touching other potential customers in the Africa region. So for this company, that territory from a commercial vantage point has been relatively negligible in terms of results. And we have some optimism that that will be a productive region for the company.

Doug Carlson
Excellent. And I guess moving to technology kind of segment, it looks like you expect it to stabilize next year. I mean what's driving that improvement?
David P. Storch
Well, I don't think it's improvement as much as we don't think there's going to be a lot more decay. So we think we've -- the major piece -- you got two major pieces in that sector. You have the Mobility business, which historically has been AAR's strongest piece of its technology business. And that business has suffered from reductions in activity in support of the U.S. government movement of troops and supplies. I think Mike indicated on a year-over-year basis, we have a revenue decline of $47 million. But I did also indicate that that's been a profit -- continues to be a profitable business. But our carrier and our commercial Cargo Systems businesses is relatively strong -- it's strong. We're on some very good platforms. We continue to support virtually all Airbus-manufactured aircraft. And we have a position on the 747-8 aircraft. So we think the commercial cargo business is decent. Is it gangbusters? No, but its decent. And then we have, as we alluded to from the last questioner, we will start making deliveries of A400M cargoes this year. And those are approximately $1.5 million per unit.
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Stan Manny with Manny's Family Investment.
Unknown Analyst
Two basic questions. One, where do you envision is the growth opportunities for 2014 and beyond?
David P. Storch
Stan, I think you'll see continued growth in our commercial activities, so I think you'll see some -- you'll see growth in our spares business and our logistics -- spares and logistics. You'll see growth in our MRO activities. And you'll see growth in our -- you should see growth in our commercial cargo systems arena. So I think you'll see some new programs. You'll see some new wins, I believe. And so you'll see, I think, continued progress in the commercial space. I think on the defense side, we've had some success here recently creating some of these unique aircraft solutions for customers. And we continue to kind of canvas the world to see who else might be interested in that kind of lower cost solution. And whether we can close something and deliver within the next fiscal -- this next fiscal year or not, might be a question. But I do believe that we will have continued success doing that kind of activity. So, yes I think you'll see good growth out of commercial markets. Our defense markets business should hold its own, notwithstanding any other dramatic cuts to budgets. And yes, I think that's where you'll see the action.
Unknown Analyst
Two -- one question that's an add on to this. The American merger or takeover, do you see that as a near-term opportunity in your maintenance business?
David P. Storch
Well, the maintenance business -- as we sit here today on this call, we have a capacity problem, right? Because we don't have a lot more space. We have some space we can accommodate some additional demand, but we couldn't accommodate a dramatic requirement as we sit here today. Now we're thinking about how we deal with that and we're trying to create -- we're trying to open up some space, so to speak. But at this moment as we sit here today, it would be hard for us to digest meaningful slug of airframe business. Now, we will -- we do think that we have a better shot at improving some of the component activity. We have -- American has not been a significant customer for the company over the years. US Air, we've had decent relationships with US Air. We do landing gear repairs, we do component repairs. We sell them some parts. So as they -- as the two businesses merge, and as the U.S. Air leadership moves into a more prominent role and a merged entity, we think that there'll be some opportunities for the company. I can't comment on the duration -- when you're talking about short term -- we're not baking in any short-term pickups -- meaningful pickups. But I think longer term, I think it bodes well for the company.

Unknown Analyst
Okay. My last question is, one I ask all the time. You have a gigantic amount of free cash flow. So can you give us your vision or priorities, whether it would be buyback, a new acquisition, pay down a debt -- could you kind of flesh that out for us please?
David P. Storch
Yes. I think that there are a few different parameters that go into that decision. So when you look at last year, we generated a significant amount of cash. We used some of that to pay down our debt, so we feel very pleased with the improvement in our debt to equity position. We used some of that to pay down -- to buy in stock. And so if you see the average purchase price of our stock, 1 million shares at $14.19 a share. And then we took some of the cash and we invested it back in the business. And I think as we look forward, I think there'll be a combination -- we'll apply to capital. We still have -- we have about $35 million remaining on our authorization from the board to purchasing shares. I think that's probably -- that's an option. I believe continuing to pay down debt is important to us. I think we'll probably, at some point in time, take a look at the board level, take a look at the dividend and see how we feel about that. And I think, obviously, returning capital and giving our shareholders a good return on their capital is important to us. So we will continue to explore all these things. Acquisitions are also in the mix as well. So, there a few different things that we're looking at, that fit in strategically very well with what we're doing. And we may be in the position to pull the trigger there. As we sit here today in the month of July, we had a very good cash generation. A good month in June. Our net debt position has improved from year end at $91 million improvement in net debt. We knocked off another $40 million of debt improvement. So when you look at June of '12 versus June of '13 our net debt is down $130 million. So we will continue to focus on all the different places we can put -- we can use the capital.
Unknown Analyst
Okay. As you're sitting here today, looking at the -- what's available on the acquisition front, because your free cash flow seems to be better than many of your comparable competitors. Do you see any near-term acquisitions as possible -- good possibilities?
David P. Storch
Stan, I'd rather not comment on that, if you don't mind. I believe that we will continue to look for good deals as they present themselves. I think I indicated some of the objectives that we have for the year. So if opportunities present themselves that match up with things that we're trying to do, then we may pull the trigger.

Our next question comes from Larry Solow with CJS Securities.
Lawrence Solow - CJS Securities, Inc.
Just a couple of follow-ups. The interest rate assumption, or the interest expense assumed to be basically flat from this quarter. But does that assume then that you don't pay down new debt? Or it's just sort of -- just sort curious how that works out.
David P. Storch
Well we've got, Larry, we've got some converts that mature. Well there's -- converts that mature, I think in February -- late February, early March, so that comes out later on in the year.
Lawrence Solow - CJS Securities, Inc.
Okay.

No. But Larry, I think you're looking at it correctly.
Lawrence Solow - CJS Securities, Inc.
That's fine. David, just in terms of the Airlift business, the sort of the big concern is what happens after Afghanistan or -- and I believe you have a lot of options. But do you see Afghanistan really, not from your sake, but just on the macro level, do you see Afghanistan's needs or demand for Airlift dropping significantly in the next year? Or do you think this can go beyond 2014?

David P. Storch
I'd be surprised if it doesn't go beyond 2014.
Lawrence Solow - CJS Securities, Inc.
Right. Okay. So there's a good chance that you may -- not that you're not looking for opportunities, but you may still be significantly there in '15?
David P. Storch
Yes.
Lawrence Solow - CJS Securities, Inc.
Okay. Last -- just a housekeeping question. The charge -- the $29.8 million debt all go into gross margin -- was that all cost of goods, or was there some -- would there be piece of that go somewhere else?
Michael Sharp
You know it's interesting Larry. It does all impact gross profit. There was a portion of it that we were required to reduce revenues. And then the rest of it went to cost of sales. But the important part is that it all impacts gross profit.
Lawrence Solow - CJS Securities, Inc.
So I guess just simple math, you can't add that back to gross margin, because I didn't get a little higher gross margin than what you guys said. Is that right? Am I doing -- I can't do that?
Michael Sharp
Right. Because there was a -- when you adjust for the impact that the sales would have been a little higher, so I think that's why you're probably off.

Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to AAR's Fiscal 2014 First Quarter Earnings Call.
Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that comments made during the call may include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as noted in our News Release and the Risk Factors section of the company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2013. In providing forward-looking statements, the company assumes no obligation to provide updates to reflect future circumstances or anticipated or unanticipated events.
At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to AAR's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, David Storch.
David P. Storch
Thank you, sir, and good afternoon. Thank you for joining us today as we discuss our first quarter fiscal 2014 performance.
I'm joined at our corporate headquarters with Tim Romenesko, our Chief Operating Officer; and John Fortson, our Chief Financial Officer; and Mike Sharp, our Chief Accounting Officer and Controller.
So here are some of the highlights from the quarter. Sales were $515 million, down 7% from $551 million the first quarter of 2013. As expected, sales in our Technology Products segment were down mostly due to lower levels of activity in our Mobility Systems business. This is partially offset by good performance at the commercial Cargo business.
In the Aviation Services segment, sales were down slightly from the prior year as we had lower sales in our supply chain business, which we expect to recover during our second and subsequent quarters. We continue to see good results in our airframe maintenance operations where we are ramping up our Duluth facility and added a third line to meet demand. Further, we have a strong quarter at our Airlift business where we continue to maintain high readiness levels.
We're pleased to report that despite lower sales, our operating margin in the quarter was 7.4%, an improvement over the 7% operating margin reported in the first quarter last year. This improvement was the result of our continued focus on cost management and higher operational efficiency across several of our businesses. Net earnings for the quarter was $0.45, equal to last year's diluted earnings per share.
In this quarter, it's also important to point out that we continue our focus on cash generation, generating $27.5 million in cash from operations and $20.3 million in free cash flow, which is in excess of our net income. We reduced our net debt by $22 million from May 31, which brings us down $109 million from August 31 last year, and paid dividends of $0.075 per share during the quarter.
In the Aviation Services segment, sales were down slightly from last year. Our MRO business continued to perform at high levels of capacity utilization, demand for maintenance services from our customers remains strong, and as previously mentioned, in late August, we added a third line in Duluth. In addition, late in the first quarter, we announced the opening of our sixth North American aircraft MRO facility in Lake Charles, Louisiana. We received a limited authorization from the FAA on August 30 to begin operations at this site, and we are in the FAA's queue to receive full authorization as soon as possible.

The facility significantly expands our capacity as it will enable us to handle up to 7 wide- or 10 narrow-body aircraft at a time. And as we sit here today, we have 4 wide-body aircraft in the facility receiving maintenance.
During Q1, our Commercial Supply Chain Management business experienced seasonal softness, which we expect to recover throughout the balance of the year, mostly on deferrals and to satisfy supply-demands that are still there but basically will occur in Q2 and beyond. Also subsequent to quarter end, we delivered the first of 2 customized 737 aircraft to the U.S. Marshal Service, and we expect to deliver the second aircraft in a few weeks.
Our Airlift business produced strong results in the quarter and continues to maintain high operational readiness levels. In early September, we received preliminary notice of intent from our customer to exercise its option of approximately $100 million of rotary wing contract revenue. As previously discussed, our Airlift business also has $110 million contract covering 12 rotary-wing aircraft expiring on November 30. We believe there are a number of different outcomes for these aircrafts, including extensions on the expiring contracts as well as fulfilling customer requirements on other contracts.
I'd like now to turn to our Technology Products segment. As anticipated, sales were down in this segment due to the year-over-year decline in our Mobility business. We expect sales of our Mobility Products business to remain steady going forward and to be neutral to prior year's results for the balance of the fiscal year. Despite the sales decline, the business continues to be a market leader and a profitable contributor to the company's results. In addition, our Commercial Cargo business continues to perform well year-over-year.
In closing, we are encouraged with our earnings and operating margin performance in the quarter as the company continued to generate strong cash flow. Sitting here today, we see many high-potential opportunities to grow the core business, both internally and externally.
Thank you for your attention and support, and I will now turn the call over to John Fortson.
John C. Fortson
Thanks, David. I'll provide a bit more color around the financial performance of the company during the first quarter, including comments around interest, cash flow, capital expenditures and capital structure. Mike Sharp and I both will be available after the call to answer any questions that you may have.
Revenues in the first quarter were $515 million versus the prior-year level of $551 million. Aviation Services revenue at $394 million was essentially flat to prior year. As David mentioned, our airframe maintenance facilities and Airlift operations continue to perform well and were offset by lower revenues in our Supply Chain business.
Technology Products revenue declined 21% quarter-over-quarter to $121 million, driven by the expected decline in demand from mobility products, which saw a $35 million sales decline from last year first quarter. Again, we expect sales of our mobility products business to remain steady going forward and to be neutral to prior-year results for the balance of the fiscal year. Our Commercial Cargo Systems performed well in the quarter.
Consolidated gross profit margin in the first quarter was 16.5% compared to 16.4% margin in the prior-year first quarter. As mentioned in our release, margins in Aviation Services segments improved to 16.6%, primarily driven by efficiency improvement in our MRO operations. On the Technology Products side, the decline in margin to 15.9% in this quarter from 19% in the first quarter of last year was primarily driven by the volume decline of mobility products.
Moving on, we did a really good job with cost management this quarter, bringing SG&A as a percentage of sales to 9.3% from 9.7% in the prior year quarter. We are attacking costs across the company and are pleased with the progress that we have made. Operating profit at 7.4% for the quarter was 40 basis points better than prior-year quarter. As we've said before, improving our operating profitability is a focus across the company, and we're pleased to see this margin improvement, particularly with the revenue decline versus the prior year.

We remain very focused on cash generation. During the first quarter, we generated $27.5 million of cash from operations. We had $7.2 million in capital expenditures and $20.3 million of free cash flow. Net interest expense for the first quarter was $10.7 million, an increase over $10.2 million from the prior year primarily due to our upsized senior notes offering. As mentioned by David, in this quarter, we reduced our net debt by $22 million sequentially and a $109 million over the 12-month period.
Depreciation and amortization, including amortization of stock-based compensation, was $21 million during the first quarter. Our first quarter diluted earnings per share is based on 39 million shares in our diluted share count, which is down 2.7 million shares from last year's level.
Thank you for your attention and operator, we're now ready to take questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Larry Solow from CJS Securities.
Lawrence Solow - CJS Securities, Inc.
Just on the aviation supply, I realize the -- firstly, you had a pretty tough comp last year. I think growth was 13% organic. And I know quarters are -- it's a seasonally slower quarter and you don't guide to the quarter. But did the little bit of the flatness catch you a little bit on surprise, it's all, I guess, in the supply chain? And is that all basically just time, really just a timing issue and...
David P. Storch
Yes, our view is, first of all, yes, to some degree, we were expecting a stronger quarter. We had a few customers who deferred heavy-engine business, for instance and therefore, pushed off some of the activity into Q2. But we are expecting to recover the shortfall from Q1 into Qs 2, 3 and 4. We also mentioned in our press release, we didn't mention in the conference call script, but we -- and that's just something we missed, but we are reaffirming full year guidance on sales and earnings.
Lawrence Solow - CJS Securities, Inc.
Right. And so I mean, you really haven't -- even in the mix between the 2 segments, hasn't really changed much? Or you still see sort of a basic -- sounds like it's all timing related?
David P. Storch
Yes, I think there's timing -- I think, Larry, if you look back 2 years ago this quarter, we had sales of about $490 million. So I think last year, we had -- we did have a strong quarter. We had a couple of individual situations that caused that to be. But so we did expect higher sales this summer from our supply chain. But it's not -- we do expect that what we did -- what did get pushed off based on what our customers are telling us, we do expect to recover that business in the out quarters.
Lawrence Solow - CJS Securities, Inc.
Okay. And I realized it's -- there's some slowness in this time anyhow. Have you seen -- are you seeing orders or activities start to pick up as you get into a little bit seasonally stronger time in the fall?
David P. Storch
Yes, I mean, I think that we're -- we feel pretty good about how the quarter is starting. And as we've mentioned also, we will be delivering 2 aircraft this quarter. So we are expecting a fairly solid quarter.
Lawrence Solow - CJS Securities, Inc.
And could you just talk a little bit about Louisiana in terms of scope? Is it sort of -- it sounds like it's similar in size to Indy, I guess, with -- you have more wide-body capabilities. But that and then the second part of the question is sort of how do you expect to ramp sort of over the next couple of years?
David P. Storch
It's very different than any other facility that we have. So you're dealing with the -- each hangar is capable of handling wide-body aircraft. And the -- we view the capacity increase as approximately 7 wide-body and 10 narrow-body aircraft. We have received provisional authorization from the FAA to do work on the aircraft. They're currently in the hangar, and we're in queue to get the full FAA license. So we're very early in that in our involvement, and it's a little bit hard to predict precisely what the ramp might be. But I would imagine that by a year from now, we'll have a much steadier -- first of all, have much more visibility. And I think we'll have a steady, steady contributing business to our profitability. So we only received the provisional certification on August 30. So we're not even a month into the -- into having the operation. We have over 100 mechanics, and we are doing work on 4 customer aircraft. And we are today looking to hire more mechanics and hopefully, we have a fully operational business by the end of the calendar year.

Lawrence Solow - CJS Securities, Inc.
Okay. And then just the last question on the SG&A. You did a great job at bringing down costs, actually especially considering you're in a down sales environment, you're seeing improved leverage. Is some of that somewhat discretionary and timing related as well? Or is that...
David P. Storch
Some are structural in nature and some -- keep in mind, last year, we were operating more facilities. We closed a couple of facilities last year. So some are structural in nature and -- but the preponderance of savings is around a sharp focus around spend. So we're watching travel, we're watching freight, we're watching office supplies, shop supplies, and we're looking at the critical materials that go into some of our manufacturing businesses. So I think it's pretty much across the board, and we're -- I believe the effort is gaining momentum.
Operator
And our next question comes from Julie Yates from CrÃ©dit Suisse.
Julie Yates - CrÃ©dit Suisse AG, Research Division
David, it looks like if you maintain this level of profitability, you'd be well ahead of the guidance that you're reaffirming today. So can you help us just kind of understand, is this conservatism? Or are there other puts and takes later on in the year that I'm not factoring in?
David P. Storch
Well, I think we always -- we prefer to be under committed and over delivered. And I think it's our preferred approach. So yes, I mean, I think we feel that we're giving the appropriate guidance based on what we know, and we hope that we perform well against that guidance and exceed it where we can.
Julie Yates - CrÃ©dit Suisse AG, Research Division
Okay. And then was the Technology Products business, was it a little bit weaker than you had anticipated? Because I think last quarter, you said that you had expected that it had leveled out?
David P. Storch
No, no, no. We had indicated that we had at least 1 or 2 more quarters. And we anticipate that we -- that we pretty well level out at the end of this -- at the period we just ended. So we don't anticipate much more in the way of decline, very minor decline in Q2, which would be better than what we had previously communicated.
Julie Yates - CrÃ©dit Suisse AG, Research Division
Okay. And then just with all the news on -- out of the Air Force on KC-10 and the risk around that fleet being scrapped with -- in sequestration, can you help us think about -- I know the flight hour contract is at 0% margin, but can you help us just think about the risk for you guys there?
David P. Storch
I think if the Air Force goes the route of taking the KC-10 fleet down, they will do that as they take on new KC-46s I believe the number is. And so at least that's the way it's been explained to us by Northrop Grumman. Of course, those deliveries don't start out, I think, into what, '15 or '16, and there's a few a year. And by the time these aircraft are out of service, our contract will have expired.
Operator
And our next question comes from Tyler Hojo from Sidoti & Company.
Tyler Hojo - Sidoti & Company, LLC
Just firstly, I was just wondering, perhaps, if you could quantify what the impact was in the quarter just from some of the deferred heavy-engine visits that you were referring to. Would commercial sales volumes, perhaps, been flat year-on-year if not for that? Just trying to put some context around that.
David P. Storch
Yes, we're just trying to answer your question. Again we'll have to do the math to figure it out. But I'd say that, that if we would have had the sales that we were expecting, we would have at least had flat commercial sales. But I think maybe...
John C. Fortson
It would've been actually...
David P. Storch
No, actually commercial sales, we just checked, commercial sales would've been stronger had the -- had what you mentioned happened.

Tyler Hojo - Sidoti & Company, LLC
Really? Okay. So talking about a pretty significant amount of work.
David P. Storch
Well, keep in mind, the decline was relatively modest. So the decline is less than -- right around 1%, a little bit over 1%. So the sales that got deferred, had those sales happened, had we hit those targets, then we would've exceeded -- we would've had commercial sales growth, yes.
Tyler Hojo - Sidoti & Company, LLC
Okay. Understood. Thanks for the clarification. And then just in regards to the guidance range, I'm just curious what you all are anticipating in terms of future contribution from joint venture income? I think it was about $1 million in the quarter.
Michael J. Sharp
Tyler, this is Mike. That amount going forward is going to be reasonably modest. It's not going to be any more -- it should not -- we don't expect it to be any more than that amount in Q2, 3 and 4. So relatively modest number.
Tyler Hojo - Sidoti & Company, LLC
Okay. And then just in context with that, maybe you could provide us an update with kind of where we stand with the owned and co-owned aircraft portfolio?
Michael J. Sharp
There's no difference in our aircraft portfolio from year end. We have, I think, 4 aircraft owned in joint venture and then 2 aircraft in our wholly-owned portfolio.
Tyler Hojo - Sidoti & Company, LLC
Okay. Great. Just a couple of other ones here. You mentioned in regards to the Airlift contract that is still outstanding, I think it's $110 million, that that's coming up, I think, in November. When would you expect to come to an agreement with your customer? Would it be sometime soon? Or would it, perhaps, stretch all the way to kind of the expiration of the contract that you currently have?
David P. Storch
I think we'll have some knowledge next week. We're expecting some knowledge next week. But there's a lot of shuffling, if you will, in terms of different possibilities and outcomes. So we're in touch with the 4-star levels, and I think there's a little bit of -- I think they're trying to move things around and aren't really ready right at this moment to commit. But we anticipate some commitments as early as next week.
Tyler Hojo - Sidoti & Company, LLC
Okay. That's great. And David, in the past, you've discussed kind of the desire, I guess, to ultimately move some of your Airlift assets outside of Afghanistan. Could you maybe talk about the pipeline there? Or are things kind of robust enough where you don't really need to worry about that anymore?
David P. Storch
Well, I think we still like to have a better balance to our fleet. So we still do worry about it and think about it, and we are offering assets into other markets. So yes, we continue to work that pretty actively. And I would say that the deal pipeline in both regards, in the currency other as well as some -- other markets, is fairly brisk at this moment. But there is a fair amount of uncertainty coming from the customer in terms of what their actual requirements might be.
Tyler Hojo - Sidoti & Company, LLC
Okay. So how would it work for you guys? Would you wait until you hear what the requirement is before you look to place additional aircraft outside of Afghanistan? Or would you be willing to essentially buy additional Airlift capability to fulfill additional contract?
David P. Storch
We may not buy. We may lease, or we may figure out another way to get -- to use that customer equipment, et cetera. So we're looking at a few different possibilities.
Tyler Hojo - Sidoti & Company, LLC
Okay. Great. And just lastly for me, I was wondering if you could provide us some guidance just in regards to CapEx and free cash flow for the year.
Michael J. Sharp
Tyler, I mean, I think you should think about our CapEx -- so we had a little over $7 million this quarter, sort of in that $30 million to $40 million range for the year, notwithstanding anything unusual. I'm sorry, what was the second part of the question?

Tyler Hojo - Sidoti & Company, LLC
Just free cash flow.
Michael J. Sharp
On the free cash flow front, I mean, what we've talked about fairly consistently over the last 12 months is identifying as our target free cash flow equal to our net income, and we've delivered on that. We've exceeded that in the last several quarters. So I think the way to think about that is equal to our net income.
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Jon Braatz from Kansas City Capital.
Jonathan P. Braatz - Kansas City Capital Associates
Going back to Louisiana, given the lease payments and so on and the amount of volume you're running through that facility, is that a little bit of a drain on your profitability early on here?
David P. Storch
Very minor. But yes, I mean, it's more of a drain at this moment than a contributor.
Jonathan P. Braatz - Kansas City Capital Associates
Okay, but not really significant.
David P. Storch
No, not really significant.
Jonathan P. Braatz - Kansas City Capital Associates
Okay. And then secondly, let's move forward, let's say 9 months, and you've done a good job of generating free cash and paying down debt. And let's say you get to a point where you paid off another $75 million or something like that, would your focus return continue to be on free cash and debt repayment? Or would you be more inclined to shift a little bit and think about acquisitions and purchases? Or would you just continue to focus on debt repayment?
David P. Storch
So Jon, I think that there's kind of -- part of our thinking today is kind of looking a little bit more externally towards investments in deals. We're also looking at investing in program activity to support some of our supply chain initiatives. So I think the free cash flow picture could change as a result of 1 or 2 of these events occurring. But in the meantime, we continue to drive the existing businesses to generate as much cash flow from operations as they can. And that energy will continue, and hopefully we'll be able to find good places to invest some of this capital we've been generating.
Jonathan P. Braatz - Kansas City Capital Associates
Do you think that could be more of a...
David P. Storch
We're focused on EBITDA, the total to net debt. And I think we're making a nice dent in that and get that ratio right, and then we'll be kind of more apt to get more aggressive externally.
Jonathan P. Braatz - Kansas City Capital Associates
Do you think that could be -- would that be more of a fiscal '15 possibility, or still something happening this fiscal year?
David P. Storch
I think it might -- yes, it's possible you'll see some stuff happening in '14.
Operator
Our next question comes from J.B. Groh from D.A. Davidson.
J. B. Groh - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division
I apologize if you've covered this, but could you give us the utilization rate in MRO in the quarter?
David P. Storch
In terms of hangar capacity?
J. B. Groh - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division
Yes, yes. How many slots are full, that kind of a thing.
Michael J. Sharp
Just kind of in general, it was a reasonably strong quarter for the MRO. During the summer, the inputs are always a little bit lighter, but they perform very well. We -- as we go into the balance of the fiscal year, the story gets a little bit tighter. But I'd say the first quarter was normal. We had some capacity. But we're able to flex the workforce, things like that, to adjust for it. So...
J. B. Groh - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division
Right. So there's the normal seasonality, but maybe if you're not willing to put out a number, I understand. But could you maybe talk about how it trended versus last quarter -- or I mean, last year rather.
Michael J. Sharp
Yes, no, it's positive in terms of the number of hours produced across the facilities.

J. B. Groh - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division
And then when you look into, say, Q2 where on a seasonal basis you'd be busier, how do the kind of advanced bookings look relative to what you did last year?
Michael J. Sharp
They look strong.
J. B. Groh - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division
So up?
Michael J. Sharp
Yes.
Operator
And our next question comes from Stan Mann from Mann Family Investments.
We do have a follow-up question from Julie Yates from CrÃ©dit Suisse.
Julie Yates - CrÃ©dit Suisse AG, Research Division
Can you guys disclose what the growth was in commercial and defense? Just the organic growth by end market?
Michael J. Sharp
Julie, the sales -- there was a sales decline in defense right around 7%, and the sales decline in commercial was right around 6%.
Julie Yates - CrÃ©dit Suisse AG, Research Division
Okay. And do you have those figures for the full year '13 as well?
Michael J. Sharp
I mean, not at my fingertips.
David P. Storch
Yes, commercial, I believe, was up 19% -- 16% -- 14%. Commercial was up 14%, and defense was down 10%.
Operator
And we have a follow-up question from Larry Solow from CJS Securities.
Lawrence Solow - CJS Securities, Inc.
Could you just update us on the Precision Manufacturing business? I know it's had a couple hiccups over the last few quarters. I think one last quarter. Any update on that?
Michael J. Sharp
So we continue to work through and address our issues there. And we feel like going into the second quarter, our performance will be significantly better than the first quarter and the last -- actually the last few quarters. So I think we're making progress on it, Larry, and I think, like I said, I think this quarter, we should start to see some meaningful results from our efforts.
Lawrence Solow - CJS Securities, Inc.
Okay. Just on Louisiana, I mean, I don't know how you can answer this, but it seems like it'll be a pretty modest negative impact early on. And maybe for the full year, not a huge impact positively. But is it -- so is it fair to say sort of a pre-breakeven, maybe slight positive for the year?
David P. Storch
I'd be disappointed if it's not positive.
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And I'm showing no one in the queue at this time. I'd like to hand the conference back over for any closing remarks.

Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the AAR CORP. 2014 Fiscal Second Quarter Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded. Now I'll turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Chris Mason. Please begin.
Chris Mason
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that comments made during the call may include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as noted in our earnings release and the Risk Factors section of the company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ending May 31, 2013. In providing forward-looking statements, the company assumes no obligation to provide updates to reflect future circumstances or anticipated or unanticipated events.
At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to AAR CORP. Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, David Storch.
David P. Storch
Hey, thanks, Chris. And with me here in our Chicago offices would be John Fortson, our Chief Financial Officer; Tim Romenesko, our Chief Operating Officer; and Mike Sharp, our Chief Accounting Officer.
I thought what I'd do today is kick this session off by providing a half year or a 6-month overview of our company and our businesses, our performance and our strategies and then drill down a little further into the quarter's results and then pass it over to John to provide some color around the financials.
Let me start by going through a performance review, drilling down into our Aviation Services businesses, and then I'll talk about our Technology Products businesses.
So starting with Aviation Services, we have the 3 different interrelated activities: supply chain, MRO, and airlift. In supply chain, our parts business has been very steady, and we are seeing steady growth in our program activity. We think of our program activity in 2 kind of regards, one of which would be airline programs.
And you can see we recently announced a new win of a program supporting airline with their expandable parts to the tune of about $40 million to $45 million per year. And then we have our distribution program activity, and you can see, we recently won a contract from EATON to support them in the sale of their products to the DLA. We're very hopeful as we perform for EATON, this will expand the opportunities between our 2 companies.
So looking at the supply chain businesses, a steady performance in our parts businesses and steady growth in our program activity. As we think about the strategy around that business and keeping in mind that supply chain is an activity that goes through all of the AAR businesses, so it's the -- it's a core competency to the company, and it's something that supports directly our MRO activities. But even as you think of some of our manufacturing and production and technology products, one of the strengths that we believe we have is our superior logistics and distribution capability.
So as we think about the supply chain piece itself, one of the things we'd like to do is build out, and we've talked about this before, geographic expansion. And we are looking at a fairly sizable deal that would expand our presence because as you know, we have a large reliance on the North American market. We, of course, do business in Europe, Asia and the Middle East, but we're looking at a particular situation that would have a meaningful difference on our program activity outside of the United States.

We also think that there are ways for us to build more capability so that our supply chain solution is a more robust solution. You may recall a couple of years ago, we've made the acquisition of Airinmar. It gave us a little specialty -- or specialization around sourcing repair capability. We're looking at other things that, in a similar fashion, make the supply chain solution a more compelling and integrated solution. And hopefully, we'll have something to talk about here in the near future.
Moving over to our MRO businesses. We've had solid performance. As you know, we're principally a North American service provider. We have recently added 2 facilities to our mix, Duluth a year ago, and I'm proud to say that we're now up to 3 lines in that facility. And as you know, back in September, we took over some space in Lake Charles, Louisiana.
We have returned our first aircraft to service for a customer there, and we're very proud of the speed in which we're able to do that, and we should be returning a second aircraft in January. And we are out in the market looking for additional wide-body maintenance customers, and my sense is that we'll have some success along this regard. And as a result, we'll have a good growth pattern for that group of -- for the MRO activity.
We are continuing to explore possibilities in other regions. To date, we've kind of struck out in this regard, but we continue to see opportunities and we continue to be apt to look at taking our technology and capability and applying it in different markets. We are also, as you know, we've had success intermittently over the years with our engineering service activity, and we're looking for ways to continue to build that piece of our MRO. It's a higher-margin activity, more value-added and something that I think would add nicely to our mix of businesses and solutions.
Lastly, in the Aviation Service businesses, we have our airlift business. This business had been performing exceptionally well, very solid operating performance. Again, you may recall, when we bought this business, it was underperforming in virtually every regard. We saw an opportunity by being able to improve their supply chain and maintenance capabilities that would allow for the fleet to be more functional.
We have had good growth in that business without having to make additional capital investments here in the last year. And most of that is coming through execution and supply chain and maintenance turn times and things of that nature. So that business has performed well.
Now obvious -- or I should say, a very large percent of that business, as we discussed in the past, is around business in Afghanistan. And we've seen a certain amount of uncertainty in the Afghanistan kind of transition, if you will, with the services agreement being delayed by Karzai, causing our customer to delay some of the orders. Although as you know, we received a contract to supply additional lift into that market. We've yet to received task orders, so we've not been able to translate the contracts into business. And we're a little bit -- we're anticipating that it's going to take a little longer than we had hoped.
So if you look at the entire Airbus -- airlift business, just to give you a sense of proportionality. We have 40 positions that we operate in around the world. And we are expecting that, of those 40 positions at the start of the year, that we will be down to 20 positions by the end of the year, and then we are anticipating that we will win an additional 9 positions that would make the differential between going from 40 at the start of the year to 29 at the end of the year.
The 3 -- there are 3 aircraft types that we will be exiting. And in those instances, the profit contribution of those 1 -- 2 fixed-wing and 1 rotary wing have been relatively negligible. So by definition, so the fixed-wing assets have been CASA 235 in the metros and the rotary wing has been the Bell 214. So those will be -- we'll be looking to do something different with those assets. But again, as they come out of the fleet, they'll simplify our fleet, but they'll also -- the profit contribution from these assets has been relatively negligible.

Longer term for this business, strategically, we're bidding on a few very large contracts, one of which is larger in size than the businesses in terms of annual revenues. We -- it's very hard to handicap what the likelihood of success may be. But this is an opportunity that we've been looking at for a few years, and it's coming home to -- it's coming into the near-term possibility range.
We also are looking at other opportunities within Africa market, and we feel very confident that we have a leadership position in this business. And we believe that the requirements, although not as heavy in Afghanistan as we have once maybe thought, we do believe that there will still be requirements there but that we are planning to grow the business outside of that market. And we have a lot of confidence in our management team, their track record, and believe that this business will continue to be an important contributor to the company, notwithstanding some of the changes that we'll be going through here as a result of some of the short-term changes in Afghanistan.
Moving along into our Technology Products business, our cargo systems business, commercial cargo systems business is, we believe, in a very good position. They did have a little softness in Q2, but we believe that's more situational than directional. And as you've seen, we've recently acquired the A320 product line from PFW, which is now 51% owned by EADS. 25% of all of A320s delivered from Airbus have cargo systems. The balance is to have lower holds that basically cargo is put in, in a minor way. So the -- we believe that we will have a very good product line there for many, many years to come and that it complements what we currently do in Germany very well.
Our defense piece of the cargo systems business should start benefiting from deliveries of A400Ms. We did deliver 3 systems in Q2, and we anticipate delivering systems now for the next 10 to 15 years. And hopefully, what we're planning on there is that we'll have a prolific spare parts business too, that as I indicated, plays into our distribution capability very nicely.
Our mobility business continues to be very steady. As we said before, we got -- we knew that that business would be declining. We indicated that we, by Q2, it would be, on a comparative basis, relatively equal, and that's where it's at. It's performing at a steady state. It's performing well, still has leadership position in its market. And we will be looking for ways to deepen and broaden the product lines around mobility since we have a leadership position there. Clearly, we'd be looking at lower multiples than you might pay for commercial products, but we will be looking for ways to opportunistically expand that business, both from a -- more of what we currently do, as well as broaden our product offering.
And lastly, in our Technology Products, we have our precision business. Our precision business continues to underperform. As I've said before, we stubbed our toe a few times in certain instances, we've made some bonehead decisions, but we have a new leadership team in place today that is a proven leadership team of the company. The business is reporting into our mobility business. This particular piece of our business enjoys excellent market conditions. So if we can get our act together, we're expecting to be able to produce positive results by Q1 of next fiscal year, but still a drag on earnings and underperforming our own internal expectations.
So now, it's kind of an overview as to how our drilling down into our segments in terms of how our businesses are performing and how we view them strategically. If I may, what I'd like to do now is get into second quarter results and, rather than regurgitate what was in the release, what I'll do is share with you kind of a little bit more detail into our different segments and their performance.

So the Aviation Service segment, sales were up 9% on a year-over-year basis; that would all be organic. Our airframe maintenance operations continue to perform at a high level of capacity utilization. Demand for our maintenance services from our customers remains strong. And in this quarter, we delivered 176 aircraft and performed work of approximately 1.3 million man-hours. So over the last 12 months, we've returned 855 aircraft to service in service to our customers, and we built over 5.1 million man-hours.
During our first quarter, we experienced seasonal softness, as you may recall, in our commercial supply chain. And as expected, we are pleased to report sales in our second quarter started to improve.
As far as our programs are concerned, we have steady performance. As I indicated in my opening comments and on December 11, we announced the signing of a 5-year contract valued at approximately $40 million annual revenue to become the sole source supplier of consumable and expendable line-item parts for a major U.S. airline. The airline has to be unnamed, so you'll have to guess who it is.
Further on the distribution side of our business, on December 18, we announced the supply chain contract with EATON to supply fluid distribution products to the -- or fluid products to the Defense Logistics Agency. And as I indicated, EATON is a significant OEM, component OEM serving the industry. We are excited that they selected us to handle the interface of these defense-related products. And we're hopeful that as we show them our performance that they'll be inclined to move us into some of their commercial lines as well.
As I indicated, airlift continued to deliver strong results as we maintained high-operational readiness levels. As we enter the second half of our fiscal year, also as I indicated, there are some moving parts. First, on October, we were awarded a 1- year extension through October 2014 for 10 rotary-wing aircraft with a contract value of approximately $150 million. We also renewed the $50 million contract with military sealift command for 4 helicopters, bearing critical supply to U.S. Navy ships.
Also, subsequent to the end of the quarter, we announced additional contracts. On December 2, we entered into a contract for 2 aircraft valued at $23 million and up to 22 months in duration with U.S. AfriCom throughout 4 Central African states. The incumbent operator has filed a protest for this contract. We do, however, believe that the agency made a correct decision in selecting us based on the requirements of the RFP and the quality of our technical solution and historical performance.
On December 3, we also announced $134 million IDIQ contract to provide fixed and rotary-wing support for the Afghan National Security Forces and under the NATO training mission. We have not received any task orders against these contracts yet and this contract, they're kind of trying to figure out how to proceed. They will be proceeding, and we expect some to break in this regard in the January time period, a little further out than we had originally anticipated but nevertheless, we do expect task orders to be led here in the near future.
We've been notified by our customer that the 10 out of 12 rotary-wing positions for the contract that expired on November 30 have been extended. 6 contract positions were extended through January 31; 1 position was extended through February 28 and March 31, respectively; and 2 contract positions were extended through April 30 of the year.
And these, as you recall, we were -- some of these we will be using for the Afghan National Security Forces once those task orders start getting led, and that the Afghan National Security Force RFP is for 18 positions. We don't know if we can fill all 18. But clearly, we'll be able to fill some of those with our existing aircraft that come off of the contract I just indicated.

So again, to put all this in perspective, at the beginning of the year, as I mentioned in my opening comments, we had 40 aircraft in revenue service. By the end of the fiscal year, 20 of these aircraft will be descoped and will be available for future mission deployment. And we expect to have 9 aircraft positions added for a total of 29 aircraft positions by the end of 2014, assuming there's no changes in requirements. We are hopeful that there will be additional requirements.
And then in the near term, we are waiting for more clarity on the status of forces discussions. In the long term, we expect airlift to be a leading business in its market and a solid contributor to our results.
In the Technology Products segment, sales were down modestly in the period as we experienced some softer sales in the cargo systems and containers on a year-over-year basis. We did announce the bolt-on acquisition of the cargo assets of PFW, which will fit very nicely into our Telair operations. And again, as I indicated earlier, this acquisition rounds out our capability in support of the A320 family of aircraft. And just as a point of reference, 25% of all A320s are outfitted with cargo loading systems and exclusively with this cargo loading system.
In addition, our mobility operations entered into a new contract to provide the DoD with specialized shipping storage containers, shelters and accessories. And we anticipate revenues of $200 million to $250 million in total over the 5-year term, and with a possibility that that contract will grow to $400 million.
So I think what I'd like to do at this point is turn -- I'm kind of running out of voice, so I'm going to turn the call over to John Fortson, who will provide some color.
John C. Fortson
Thanks, David. I will provide a little more color around the financial performance of the company during the second quarter, including comments around interest, cash flow, capital expenditures and capital structure. And Mike Sharp and I both will be available after the call to answer any questions that you may have.
Revenues in the first quarter were $540.7 million versus the prior year level of $512.8 million. Aviation Services revenue at $424.7 million was up 8.7% in comparison to the year -- the prior year. As David mentioned, all of the businesses in this segment performed well. Technology Products revenue were -- was $116 million and declined 4.9% from last year's levels as a result of softer sales in our cargo systems and container operations. In our mobility systems, this is the first quarter since the second quarter of 2012 in which sales were on a comparable basis from a demand level, and we expect them to remain steady going forward.
During the quarter, sales to commercial customers were 57% of total sales compared to 60% of consolidated sales in the second quarter of last year, with the balance of sales attributable to government and defense. The second quarter defense sales included the sale or include the delivery of 2 aircraft to the U.S. Marshals Service.
Consolidated gross profit margin in the first quarter was 16.8% compared to 17% margin in the prior year first quarter. As mentioned in our release, margins in Aviation Services segments declined to 16.8% from 17.2% in the prior year period as a result of unfavorable margin mix. On the Technology Products side, margins increased to 17% in comparison with the prior year.
Similarly, the first quarter in fiscal year 2014, we did a great job of cost management this quarter, bringing SG&A as a percentage of sales to 9.5% from 9.9% in the prior year quarter as a result of a combination of higher sales and effective cost management. We remain focused on cost control across the company and expect further progress.
Operating profit at 7.5% for the quarter was 10 bps better than prior year quarter. As we've said before, improving our operating profitability is a focus across the company, and we're pleased to see this margin improvement.

We also remain very focused on cash generation. During the second quarter, we generated $38.8 million of cash from operations. We had $7.1 million in capital expenditures and $31.7 million of free cash flow. Further, we paid $3 million in dividends.
Net interest expense for the first quarter was $10.2 million, a decrease from $10.5 million in the prior year. We continue to delever the company. And as of November 30, net debt was reduced by $29 million sequentially and by $127 million from November 30, 2012. As David mentioned, our net debt levels are down by almost $180 million from its peak in Q3 of fiscal year 2012 right after we closed the acquisition of Telair and Nordisk.
Depreciation and amortization, including amortization of stock-based compensation, was $22.3 million during the second quarter. Our second quarter diluted earnings per share is based on 39.2 million shares in our diluted share count, which is down 2.3 million shares from last year's level.
As communicated in our press release, given our expectations for fewer aircraft positions at our airlift operations during the second half of the year, we are adjusting both our revenue and diluted earnings per share guidance for fiscal year 2014. For the full year, we expect to generate revenues in the range of $2.1 billion to $2.15 billion and diluted earnings per share in the range of $1.95 to $2 per share.
Thanks for your attention. And operator, we're now ready to take questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Julie Yates Stewart of Credit Suisse.
Julie Yates - CrÃ©dit Suisse AG, Research Division
On the supply chain, last quarter, you talked about the customer deferrals of having maintenance on engines. It sounded like, from your comments, that this has improved some. Can you just give us an update on what you're seeing in the business?
David P. Storch
We had strength in the quarter, and we have made some investments in inventory for anticipated strength continuing into Q3 and Q4. So the business clearly had a dip in Q1, but it is not exactly where we wanted to be but significantly higher than Q1. So Q2 was a good quarter. And we anticipate, with some investments we've recently made in Q2, that we would anticipate that we'll have some strength in Qs 3 and 4.
Julie Yates - CrÃ©dit Suisse AG, Research Division
Okay. And then on the -- with your comments on the distribution business and the win with the major airline, can you help us understand exactly what you guys are doing on the distribution side and whether you're starting to compete with the likes of Wesco and B/E here?
Michael J. Sharp
Julie, in this particular situation, we are really taking over the supply of consumable and expendable products for the airline, so everything from the sourcing of the parts to delivering it to the bins at the airline. So it's an extension of what we've been doing, but -- and it's similar to what some of the others are doing. But it's an area that -- where we're leveraging our systems, we're leveraging our relationships and we're leveraging our core capabilities.
Julie Yates - CrÃ©dit Suisse AG, Research Division
Okay. And then just lastly on the guidance. If you guys can help us understand the positives and the negatives, with the positives being the new acquisition, the distribution contracts and the negative being airlift and perhaps a little bit of weakness in the cargo side, just maybe helping us size those different pieces.
John C. Fortson
Yes. So Julie, it's John. Yes, I mean, look, as we've thought about it, this has obviously been -- there's been a lot of planning and analysis going on and particularly as we've gotten sort of more visibility around what airlift is going to do, right? It has been a particularly strong first half of the year. I think from our perspective, you can kind of look at the aircraft positions and make a rough guesstimate as to how we think the business will impact in the back half of the year. It will get offset by positive contributions, particularly, I think, in the fourth quarter in the supply chain parts of our business, and also offset by some improvement in our Technology Products, specifically our commercial Cargo Loading Systems business. So positive supply chain, positive cargo loading services offsetting and mitigating some of the downward pressure that you're seeing from airlift.

Operator
Next question is from Larry Solow of CJS Securities.
Lawrence Solow - CJS Securities, Inc.
David, can you just clarify that the 40 positions, if that was a fiscal year-end '12 or calendar year-end '12? I know you're saying 30 at calendar year end now, basically, and then back to -- or 20 now and then back to 29 at the end of calendar '14, is that what you're saying, or are these fiscal years?
David P. Storch
Yes, so fiscal -- starting the fiscal year, we had 40 positions. We lost a few positions between end of the fiscal year and now. And then we're -- and so expecting for -- from fiscal year start to end where we had start with 40, of those 40, 20 are going to go away is our best estimate...
Lawrence Solow - CJS Securities, Inc.
Right, by fiscal year end of the...
David P. Storch
And then we believe between now and fiscal year end, we will come -- we will win 9 new positions.
Lawrence Solow - CJS Securities, Inc.
Got it. So basically, from now, you already -- you basically, had you lost a few positions already or are you really...
David P. Storch
Yes.
Lawrence Solow - CJS Securities, Inc.
Right, okay.
David P. Storch
Yes, we had lost some positions in Q2.
Lawrence Solow - CJS Securities, Inc.
Okay. And the position, the 9 you expect to add, is that mostly -- is that assuming that some deal gets some of these task orders? Is that...
David P. Storch
Yes, yes. And we're expect -- yes, so we're hoping that -- we're expecting the protest -- we believe the protest is frivolous. And we believe that will be over -- that will be ruled in our favor. So those would be 2 that would go back -- going to Africa. We believe that we're probably going to win -- we're in the vicinity of 4 to 5 task orders in Afghanistan. And then we believe there's another 2 rotary wings that we'll win in Africa.
Lawrence Solow - CJS Securities, Inc.
Okay. Okay, so that will the increment -- additional 2 incremental that you haven't announced yet for Africa?
David P. Storch
You're correct.
Lawrence Solow - CJS Securities, Inc.
And the 4 to 5 task orders, you say you think you'd get, that's of the potential 18 that you could get, not today, but in theory?
David P. Storch
Yes, that's correct.
Lawrence Solow - CJS Securities, Inc.
Okay, okay. Just a couple of other questions, the 5-year contract you just announced, the $40 million to $45 million, is that a potential number, is that a number you have to ramp towards? How should we look at that?
Michael J. Sharp
That's our expectation of the first year performance. We do think that there's opportunities to build on that. Larry, just to maybe follow up a little bit on Julie's question too, I mean, we provide this kind of support for our own internal shops. It's just that we haven't had large programs like this with external customers. So it's something that we know very well, and we expect that we can build off of this program with this customer and with other new customers.
Lawrence Solow - CJS Securities, Inc.
Okay. And the distribution agreement with Eaton that you announced, is that -- can you put any numbers to that? I mean, is that somewhat small -- I imagine in like the Unison deal, but how does that compare? Is it much smaller? Is it -- can you put any quantification on that?
David P. Storch
It's, in the zip code, slightly smaller. But we prefer -- I think at their request, we prefer not to put the numbers to that.
Lawrence Solow - CJS Securities, Inc.
So that would be -- it's actually a decent size. And does that one take longer to ramp? Because I know Unison took a while, and I don't know...
David P. Storch
Yes, you'll see that will take a little longer. Unison, of course, had a much broader range of customers; this has a narrower range. So I think it probably shouldn't take quite as long, but there will be a ramp period there.

Lawrence Solow - CJS Securities, Inc.
And is Unison now up to like this $60 million that it was, I think -- when it was signed, that it's supposed to be. Is that ballpark to where it is now?
David P. Storch
Yes, I think it's a little bit less than that, but it's clearly meaningful.
Lawrence Solow - CJS Securities, Inc.
Okay. And then just a couple of other quickies. Duluth, I guess, you're up to your third line. Is there -- is that -- do you see that going to 4 anytime soon? Or is that -- is 3 sort of a number you expect for the near term?
David P. Storch
The goal is to get to 4, and I think let's get through 3. It's a manning challenge. And at this time of year, people aren't dying to fly up to Duluth to work.
Lawrence Solow - CJS Securities, Inc.
Yes, it's snowing. Yes, you're right. So maybe in the summer...
David P. Storch
Yes, right. Right.
Lawrence Solow - CJS Securities, Inc.
And how about the other facility, in the Miami -- they're all running -- it sounds like they're all running pretty high...
David P. Storch
I think Q2, they ran strong. I think Q3, we get into the holiday season, you should expect some softness there, but typical, nothing unusual.
Lawrence Solow - CJS Securities, Inc.
And mobility, was that actually -- was that flat year-over-year or was it -- I thought it was supposed to be down a little more this quarter and then sort of flatten out -- it's pretty flat.
David P. Storch
I think relatively flat, slightly, slightly down, but not in a meaningful way.
Lawrence Solow - CJS Securities, Inc.
And you see it sort of being flat at least in the near term, is that fair to say?
David P. Storch
Yes, right.
Operator
[Operator Instructions] The next question is from Tyler Hojo of Sidoti & Company.
Tyler Hojo - Sidoti & Company, LLC
Just the first question is just if you look at commercial aviation sales in aggregate, it looks like those volumes are roughly flat year-on-year in 2Q. And just when I go through kind of the prepared commentary, obviously, MRO is up, supply chain is up. Just kind of wondering what the offset is. Is that -- is the offset on the precision business? Just a little help there.
John C. Fortson
Yes, I think, that's fair, all right? It's softness around precision and also in our cargo loading systems businesses, right? So it's Technology Products that kind of drove it. But your correct, it's kind of flat to down like 1%.
Tyler Hojo - Sidoti & Company, LLC
Okay. And could you maybe talk a little bit about what -- what's going to be the catalyst to turn precision around? I think, David, you said Q1, you were expecting kind of a shift in that business.
David P. Storch
Yes, and we have had improvement. So the Q2 is better than Q1. It's still low, operating in the red, I guess, was my point. And we've got -- so the team operating the business now, we shifted the management in early summer. And the business now reports to our mobility GM and who reports to Dany Kleiman who you may have met, Tyler. And Dany, before he left Israel Aircraft (sic) [Aerospace] Industries, was running their MRO business, the deck aviation. But before that, he was in charge of their manufacturing plant, building the airplane, the G250, as well as building parts for Boeing under contract. So he has -- they put some discipline in place, which will -- which has already yielded improvements. We now have to win customer confidence back. And we've -- we did some -- I made a comment about bonehead decision, what -- one of the prior manager have made some pricing decisions that, quite frankly, pissed off some of the customers. So we're now trying to recover some of those customer relations, and I think the key to recovering customer relations is doing a fabulous job on operational stuff. And so the guys are fixing the operation, which I think is getting close to where we want to be and now we have to regain the customer confidence and make them feel good -- make them feel better about what we're doing and then probably give some price concessions so that we regain their trust.

Tyler Hojo - Sidoti & Company, LLC
Okay. But longer term, David, are we still thinking that precision could be additive to kind of the long-term margin goals that you [indiscernible] ?
David P. Storch
Absolutely, and it should be. And it's really -- I mean, I've got to watch my language because I'm not happy about it, but we really have, to put it mildly, stubbed our toe. I mean this is, of all our different subset markets, this is probably the healthiest of all the markets. So we should be enjoying some of what's going on in the build cycle in this business, and we're not. So we've got to fix it. We know we have to do confidence in the team that we have in place today to fix it. And I would hope that next year, at this time, while we're talking, it will be contributing to the profitability and hopefully additive to margins.
Tyler Hojo - Sidoti & Company, LLC
Okay, wonderful. And just maybe on another topic. When you talk about the, I guess, it's 11 airlift assets that are going to be unutilized at the end of this fiscal year, just curious what kind of the current thinking is surrounding them. I mean, would you prefer to sell them or place them somewhere else?
David P. Storch
Well, there's probably 7 assets that we would probably look to sell. And because one of the things that we'd like to do is simplify the fleet. So at one point in time, we're operating 9 aircraft type. And if we sell these 3 aircraft type, we've already gotten rid of 1 aircraft type, we'd be down to 5 -- 2 fixed-wing type, the Havlin-8s [ph] and CASA 212s, and then we'd be down to 3 rotary wings, which would be the S-92s, the S-61s and the Puma. So that would be ideal state for us. So -- but let's see with that -- we have one of the aircraft that we have out, the CASA 235s, we actually have some requirements for, so we're kind of arm wrestling as to whether we want to -- what we want to do exactly with those requirements.
Tyler Hojo - Sidoti & Company, LLC
Okay, that's interesting. And maybe just one follow-on to that. Kind of one of the discussions, at least I've been having, is just what some of the underlying value is with some of the airlift assets that's on your books, do you have any idea what the market value is of the 7 birds that you're looking to sell?
David P. Storch
Yes, the book value is $30 million. And we think the market value is pretty close to that level. And hey, Tyler, if you're still there, the value I gave you includes all the spares that support those fleet types as well. So it's the aircraft themselves, plus the spares, engines and spares.
Operator
The next question is from Kevin Ciabattoni of KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Kevin Ciabattoni - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division
Looking at the recent distribution of supply chain wins, Eaton and the unnamed airline customer, can you give us an idea of what -- are there meaningful startup costs involved in those in terms of infrastructure, inventory, what have you, that may be kind of dilutive to margins early on?
Michael J. Sharp
There aren't really any significant startup costs. We will be putting a team in place. We're going to be warehousing this out of one of our existing facilities. We're going to take on some additional space in that facility. We'll invest a little bit of capital to mezzanine the shipping area. In terms of the provisioning of the inventory, we will be and have started issuing purchase orders, so there'll be working capital investment. But no costs or startup costs that are significant that would have a negative impact on margins.
Kevin Ciabattoni - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division
Okay, perfect. And then on the airlift, you mentioned you hadn't received any task orders for the NATO contract in Afghanistan. But I assume that that is still -- that contract is still included in the outlook for the year, despite the fact you understate orders, is that correct?

David P. Storch
Yes, it's part of the reason for kind of our taking a softer look at the second half earnings because we had originally been anticipating that those task orders would have been issued by now and that we have had the benefit of those assets operating in Q3. We're now a little bit -- we're taking a more cautious view and thinking it's going to take a little longer. Of course, we still have the task orders to go ahead and deploy those assets.
Kevin Ciabattoni - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division
Okay. And then in airlift, you mentioned at the beginning of the call a large opportunity you're looking at kind of outside of the existing business. I was just wondering, I mean, can you give us any color whether that -- what kind of end market, I mean, are we looking at military, government, commercial? Can you give us any color on where that would be?
David P. Storch
Yes, let's call it government.
Kevin Ciabattoni - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division
Okay, fair enough. And then last one from me. It's kind of a longer-term question, but we saw Air Canada order a number of Boeing narrow-bodies recently. Just wondering long term what the impact of that shift would be at Duluth?
David P. Storch
Well, longer term, it depends on what you're talking about, right, in terms of longer term. I mean, at some point in time, obviously, today, in Duluth, we're doing their A320 fleet. I would expect that the order from Boeing was to replace some of those assets. I'm not sure -- I don't recall, although I believe I did see it, but I don't recall when those aircraft come into the Air Canada's fleet.
Kevin Ciabattoni - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division
Yes, 2017 would be the earliest that they're looking at at this point.
David P. Storch
Yes, yes. Yes, so I think as they phase in, I don't know how many a year of the -- whether they ordered 69 or...
Kevin Ciabattoni - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division
In the ballpark, about [indiscernible] that number.
David P. Storch
Yes. So I think there were 80 A320s currently in the fleet, if I remember correctly. So I would imagine that over time, they'll be transitioning A320s out and probably transitioning 737s in.
Kevin Ciabattoni - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division
And you would be able to, I mean, at this point, obviously, that's a ways off, but you think you'd be able to handle the Boeing aircraft in Duluth?
David P. Storch
Absolutely. I have to check the stats to know if we can handle 3 or 4. But we would definitely be able to handle at least 3.

Next question is from J. B. Groh of D.A. Davidson.
J. B. Groh - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division
You mentioned the working capital investment, is there any way to -- on some of these new contracts, is there a way to quantify that? Or how should we think about it in terms of kind of days of inventory versus that $40 million to $45 million?
Michael J. Sharp
Yes. I think we should see inventory turns in that program of 3x to 4x. Maybe not right at the start, but I think it should have decent turns.
J. B. Groh - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division
Okay. And this is -- Okay, so a little bit of it. Okay, not a huge -- very slow event. And then what's the pace on the A400M now? You said 3 for the quarter. Is that kind of what the expectation is over the next several quarters?
Michael J. Sharp
It moves around. Some are a little more than that. But yes, it's starting to get into a pretty, pretty good ramp here. So yes, it goes up from here.
J. B. Groh - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division
And that all shows up in technology?
Michael J. Sharp
Correct.
David P. Storch
Let me, if I may, you made a comment about the terms and investments in those -- for those programs. Let me also add one more thing and that we mentioned it in the question that Julie asked about the -- some of our businesses in the spare parts arena. We did, in this quarter, generate meaningful cash -- positive cash flow, and in cash flow in excess of our net after-tax earnings. And keep in mind that, that includes a significant investment in inventory to support our supply chain business. So we increased our supply chain inventory by approximately $20 million that should go ahead and augur well for Q3 and Q4 in that business, so the cash flow taken into consideration investments in inventory to support the growth of the business.

J. B. Groh - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division
That's almost -- I mean, I guess, I always kind of look at those as kind of like an acquisition almost, right? I mean...
David P. Storch
Absolutely.
J. B. Groh - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division
And then so maybe you could, hopping back in here, sort of prioritize cash flow deployment. It sounds like you're working on potential -- some other potential transactions, but what else?
David P. Storch
Yes, clearly, as you know, I mean, we're -- our supply -- we are supporting and growing our supply chain, looking to support and grow our supply chain businesses. So there will be capital applied to those businesses. And I signaled in my strategic overview some additional things that we're looking to do to build out our capabilities. So we're feeling pretty good about where we stand right now in terms of opportunities for capital deployment. And it helps that we generate the kind of cash that we have over the last 1 to 1.5 years.

Next question is from Jon Braatz of Kansas City Capital.
Jonathan P. Braatz - Kansas City Capital Associates
Most of my questions were answered. I was going to ask about the A400. But in your text, you talked about the sales of 2 aircraft to the U.S. Marshals Service. How much was that, and was there any profit associated with it?
David P. Storch
It was a fairly thin-margin transaction. I think we're -- we may have announced, or I don't recall precisely if we announced the sales, and we may be prohibited from doing that. But it was a relatively thin-margin transaction. One of the things that we're trying to secure there, keep in mind that their headquarter, their air operation is at the Oklahoma City Airport where we have our maintenance operation. We are goal/ambition to do the maintenance support for that fleet of aircraft.
Jonathan P. Braatz - Kansas City Capital Associates
Okay. So how many aircraft do you have now remaining in your portfolio?
David P. Storch
6.
Jonathan P. Braatz - Kansas City Capital Associates
Six, okay. Okay. Any timetable that you would like to reduce that by? Do you have a timetable?
David P. Storch
Yes, I'd like to get them done by the end of the quarter, if we could, but I don't think it's going to happen. I think, realistically, I think that we have 2 767s on lease with United. Those come down nicely, I'm not sure yet. I think those expire in '16 or '17 -- '15, '16, so I'm not sure if we've we heard from United yet as to what their intentions might be at that stage. Keep in mind, they've invested fairly heavily in the interiors on that aircraft. So just not sure what their plan is. And then we have 747 on lease with Delta that they have plans to operate for a long time. I guess we have that in the finance category now. And -- so yes, I would say that I would anticipate this fleet will move out of our portfolio in the next 3 to 4 years.

The next question is from Stan Manning [ph] of Manning Family Investors [ph].
Unknown Analyst
Several questions. One, can you talk to the thoughts on the American-US Air merger and its possible effects on your business?
David P. Storch
First of all, I think it's good for the industry. I think it has a potential of being positive for us. The US Air management team is integrating, I think, well with the American management team. And I would expect that as the time goes on, they'll be looking at their maintenance spend and trying to figure out how to do that most efficiently. And I would hope that they would view AAR as somebody who can assist them in that regard. We do business today in support of US Air. We do less business in support of American. But we would be optimistic that we'd be able to convince them that we offer competitive solutions for them.
Unknown Analyst

Are your current maintenance locations conducive to helping them?
David P. Storch
Well, they have a heavy -- one of their core markets would be the Miami market, and we have a maintenance facility at the Miami Airport. So that would be very conducive. And I think that the wide-body facility we have in Louisiana, although not necessarily right on their network, I think -- I'm certain they have lots of airplanes that fly over that location. So it's not totally inconvenient. It's not perfect because it's probably not on their route network, but it's probably not totally inconvenient. So yes, our facilities, I think, are in a good physical location for their business.
Unknown Analyst
Okay. Last question, as you've mentioned a large acquisition outside the U.S, can you speak to how you would do that deal relative to your current balance sheet and cash flow?
David P. Storch
Yes, so a large -- it's going to be meaningful for the supply chain businesses. It wouldn't be a -- it's not a deal-changer kind of large. It's a very affordable opportunity. So I would imagine that we would actually pay for it out of our cash account. And yes, I think -- yes, I think -- yes, that's about it, Stan.
Unknown Analyst
Okay, last question is your thoughts on increasing operating margin near term or long term.
David P. Storch
It's a goal of ours. We continue to stay focused around it. This quarter, we struggled a little bit in terms of the gross margins. But you can see we continue to manage our SG&A, and it gave us a slight improvement in operating margins. We didn't have a needle mover. But as we continue to go through the portfolio and assess our different businesses and where we want to put more emphasis, it would be our goal to improve operating margins.
Unknown Analyst
Okay, so you can see gains in the future?
David P. Storch
Yes.

Our next question is from Donovan Chaney of Wells Fargo.
Donovan Chaney - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division
Most of my questions have been answered. But did you guys comment yet on your free cash flow goal? I think last quarter, you were targeting free cash flow of about equal to or a little bit greater than net income. Does that -- how does your working capital investment for that new supply chain win or maybe the lower airlift business kind of shrink that? Is that something to think about?
David P. Storch
Yes, I think free cash flow for the balance of the year will be under a little bit of pressure because we just made this acquisition of the cargo system product line over in Germany, and we have won these recent supply chain deals, which will require capital investment. So our internal goal, up until some of these investments we've made, has been what you've indicated. We -- the second half of the year might be a little bit harder to achieve it. So that will be cash flow from operations. We're still expecting that number to be -- continue to do well, but we might be a little challenged on free cash flow.

Our next question is from Julie Yates Stewart of Credit Suisse.
Julie Yates - CrÃ©dit Suisse AG, Research Division
Just 2 follow-ups for me. David, on the precision business, would you consider selling this if you can't realize the improvement you're targeting? I would imagine multiples for these types of businesses are pretty attractive, given the positive cycle dynamics and the consolidation we've already seen.
David P. Storch
So Julie, the answer is yes, we would, but we have to get into the black first. Because if you do it -- if you multiply by a loss, there's no real multiple. So we got to get our act together in the business and we've got the right team on it. And we will get it fixed.
Julie Yates - CrÃ©dit Suisse AG, Research Division
Okay. And then second, did you guys look at the airborne systems business that Trans Am acquired?

David P. Storch
Yes.
Julie Yates - CrÃ©dit Suisse AG, Research Division
Okay. Did you get outbid or is it something that you just...
David P. Storch
No, first of all, I won't comment on it, but we did look at it.

Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen and welcome to AARâs Fiscal 2014 Third Quarter Earnings Call. 
Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that the comments made during the call may include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 as noted in our news release and the Risk Factors section of the Company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2013. In providing forward-looking statements, the company assumes no obligation to provide updates to reflect future circumstances or anticipated or unanticipated events. 
At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to AARâs Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, David Storch.
David P. Storch
Thank you, sir and good afternoon. Thank you for joining us today to discuss our third quarter fiscal 2014 performance. With me in Chicago are Tim Romenesko and John Fortson and few other senior folks here at the company. 
On todayâs call I would like to start by discussing our third quarter results and then providing with an explanation about actions we are taking to counter the revenue decline we experience and how we are positioning our company for future growth.
Let me begin with Aviation Services; in the Aviation Services segment, sales were down 10% from last year to $368 million as mentioned in our press release our MRO operations had difficult quarter, sales were down $24.3 million in that sub-segment within our Aviation Services Group. 
Sales in the airframe maintenance facility were lower by approximately $5 million as we conclude several large 757 maintenance programs. In this call, I will give you a sense of our billable hours of 1.1 million as opposed to 1.3 million in the prior year. 
Sales in our engineering services unit where we completed a sizeable engineering service program were down by $10 million. We have engineering service work, but not of the same size or stock as we had last year with the program we completed and you may recall that this is the business from time-to-time we win contracts and there are times where we have a low-end activity. 
Our Landing Gear and Component Repair revenues were down $9.4 million due to the repair cycle declined for Landing Gear and just lower input from component. That address the weakness in MRO activity in this quadrant position of the business for the future, we have narrowed the focus of our leadership team to try to improve performance. In this regard, we had Dany Kleiman who runs MRO performing other functions of the company, weâve moved in back to MRO only and put a little bit more sales emphasis around him, so that we can recapture some business.
Now we are actively pursuing entry into E-Jet after- market support. We believe that the aircraft is selling well in the United States and we line up well. Itâs a good fit for the company. We have the airframe, landing gear and component, repair capability weâve good enough product knowledge. As you can see from one of the awards that we announced, weâve had some success supporting that platform. 
We also plan to expand our world-class landing gear repair and overall capability into ancillary product line including actuation, wheels, and brakes. We have discussed before the landing gear repair cycles about 10 year cycle, weâre still suffering from the lack of new aircraft sales into the market back in the 2003, 2004 time period. But as you recall, the markets got little bit firmer in the 2004, 2005 or 2006 time period which should bode well again for our landing gear business. 

We have not lost any contracts. We have one contract. The existing customer base requirement is softer today than it would at another point in time in that repair cycle. In our commercial supply chain operations sales were down by 2% as we restructured a current and existing contract. This was a Time and Material contract that we shifted over to Power-by-the-Hour. Although the sales from that program are down as sales, the income contribution from that program is relatively flat. 
So you have roughly $10 million to $12 million less to sales but roughly the same earning contribution. We do believe that this business had been somewhat negatively impacted by weather conditions in the period. We didnât talk about that really in the earnings release and we have fundamental because itâs very hard for us to quantify but in the two months in January and February they were 74,500 flights that were canceled, and of course the parts business is tied very much to take off the landing and of course the year aligned cash flows impacted in a way that they can defer certain maintenance events and they can defer certain acquisitions of inventory as we see in the past. 
Theyâll do so and just to give you a sense of the change in parts business on a sequential basis, our revenues were down $7 million from second quarter in our commercial parts business.
Now the temporary step back that weâd experienced, we believe we counterbalance by strong momentum and a signing new contracts as indicated in the earning release. During last quarter-end, we announced several new distribution supply agreements with blue-chip customers. And Iâll try and provide a little additional color for why these contracts are important for the company that you would not have seen in the earnings release. And so if you look at the Sabena acquisition, it puts a supply chain group in the position offer true notable inventory pooling support to customers in the European Middle East and Africa region. And Iâd say a true global inventory pooling. 
Our inventory management programs today have been more designed around individual customers and providing inventory to that customer. This will be our first venture if you will into pooling where the inventory is available for multiple aircraft operate flying the same platform. This business is currently headquartered in Brussels and will continue to be headquartered in Brussels. Weâve opened up a new warehouse and will be operational on this business on or about April 1. 
And we believe it will give us the size, the scope and the scale and the infrastructure that will allow us to compete effectively in these markets and these markets are dominated by Lufthansa, Air France and some of the other major airline players. Weâre hoping that by independent provider that that will be a point of differentiation that will allow us to capture more business and grow this particular piece of our business.
Weâve talked about this U.S. airline win. Itâs been requested that we will not disclose the name of the airline, but this new line of business for this supply chain group is offering consumable and expandable support and we believe by doing this successfully for this airline that there will be other airlines who will expect interest which has actually been the case, but since weâve announced this agreement, weâve received multiple requested design expandable support programs for other customers in North America and in Asia.
The Eaton win builds on a success with Unison and establishes AAR as the clear alternative for OEM as they look to access more diversified channels to market. So AARâs access to the matter [ph] is Power-by-the-Hour agreements, MRO network and expendable support offering to get OEMs excited and gets them closer to the point of demand. As they look to streamline their marketing initiative in the case of Eaton and in the case of Unison, they decide to reduce the number of vendors that theyâve worked with and they choose AAR as a preferred distribution source for their products.

Our strategic initiatives with OEMs, Iâll name a few; Honeywell, Thales, Liebherr Rockwell, Technofan, allowing us where they stand behind us and they are powered by our agreements allow us to we believe, it gives us a what we consider to be a superior option to the airline, large airline MRO powered by our support offering and weâve had some success in some of the programs we have talked about before by doing this. 
And we have ramped up our efforts to capture foreign military sales opportunities in terms of programs and material distribution, particularly given the slowdown in U.S. defense spending and we should have some wins that we can announce shortly.
As far our airlines business, as expected, sales were down and in period they were down $13 million. Since our last call in December, we have the following updates that these scoping at a rotary-wing position for the contract that expired on November 30 has proceed as plan and we are expecting to remain free contract positions to be completed by the end of April. 
We are currently not flying any aircraft under the new USAFRICOM contract due to a protest that was filed by the incumbent operator and we are expecting decision coming out of JAO shortly and hopefully we will be able to begin work on that contract soon. 
No task force have been received to date for the new NATO 18 contract announced in December and you might recall that we have four aircrafts that we have more or less designated for that contract. We are in the process of streamlining our fleet as weâve discussed before reducing the number of aircraft types that we offer the market. In that regard weâll be selling off nine different aircrafts that will no longer be required for our long range plan for this business.
So from todayâs perspective, we think to end our fiscal 2014 with its haul of 23 aircraft positions, this is a difference from the previously communicated number of 29 which we mentioned in our December call and purely relates to the four delayed NATO Allies [ph] past quarters and the delayed ramp-up in Africa associated with that protest where we were the winning bidder and we are just waiting for the protest to clear and well hoping to clear as favorably â clear in our favor.
I should continue by saying that we do see good prospects for our Airlift Services globally. We are actively engaged on diversifying operations away from Afghanistan and managing through expense of proposal on the bid activity, more specifically we are pursuing SOCOM [ph] and AFRICOM opportunities. We are looking to leverage our success in VirTrap [ph] and that's a maybe contract and DoD expertise to extend this in search and rescue mission.
We are pursuing expansion opportunities through the Fly America Act. We are looking to expand our product offerings into GOCO opportunities this is government supplied aircraft in currently all of our businesses with aircraft that we provide, government does have contracts where they have assets and they look for contractors like us to provide a lift without providing the actual equipment. And then continuing with our fleet optimization to achieve the greatest operating profit potential. 
So as we look at the quarter have ended although our revenues were down by 13 million, the profit contribution from this business was relatively flat. So there was virtually no degradation in earnings contribution from the business with even though they had less contract positions and less revenue.
That pretty much concludes my discussion around aviation services. Let me move over to Technology Products. In this segment sales were down 4.8% to $107 million even though we had sales growth in our cargo systems and container business where we had sales increase of $4 million. This was offset by mobility products where we had good visibility. We knew that there would be a soft period. 

Sales were down $6 million in that period. So and as we mentioned earnings release we did renew and signed some new contracts for the mobility business and we do expect fourth quarter revenues to be higher for that business than third quarter revenues were.
So our management focus in this segment is a continued ramp of the A400M program, execution of our successful cargo strategy for Telair and Nordisk, expense of our mobility products offering through continued innovation, continue to come up with lighter weight solution and capture new customers as weâve been in this period with the British. Deepening growth, the engineering solutions work with OEMs and continue to improve their performance of our precision machining operations.
Iâll say just before I turn the call over to John, I could say that historically our businesses we have experienced rotation in our performance around customer requirements and shifting markets and as we sit here today we see near-term demand for Airlift and certain MRO services declined but we do see an increase in supply chain activity as indicated by some of the deals that we just recently mentioned. 
So if I look back in time, if I look at the first decade a century, we have a clearly robot aircraft sales and leasing activity contributing sales and earnings to the company and when the financial crisis of July hit that business more or less, now suffered than we managed our way largely out of that activity, and our mobility business picked up. And surely after mobility went down we had good growth at Telair and Airlift.
Now Airlift is done, and weâre looking for contribution from our supply chain. So I think this is a historical kind of perspective for the company. This quarter I think we got quite a little short. We then see â we knew the contracts that were coming off, but we are hoping to get new contracts as commenced we have in the past that would replace but I just might that Iâm very proud aside from the disappointment on the sale side at least on the earnings side we were able to keep that relatively respectable.
So, with that thank you for your attention, I would like to turn it over to John to provide some additional financial color.
John C. Fortson
Thanks David. I would like to refer everyone to our press release for general financial information for this quarter and use this time to hold on some specific actions we are taking to rightsize and manage our costs and capital structures in this environment.
I will be available after the call to answer any questions you may have. The impact of the revenue decline in earnings was reduced by aggressive cost management and operational efficiencies, particularly at Airlift where we experience significant revenue decline, but had higher operating margins, and as David mentioned had a net effect of income from this business to be flat year-over-year.
Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales were 9.6% for the third quarter compared to 8.0% for last year. However last year included a onetime benefit of $9 million from an acquisition adjustment. If you adjust for this, our SG&A for this quarter was approximately $5 million lower or about 10%. We will continue to make adjustments to our cost structure where appropriate to reflect these lower sales levels.
We are in the process reviewing all sources of spend cross the company about strategic and non-strategic defined cost savings. We will complete our reviews our healthcare insurance as well as freight and travel. We are now focused on other non-strategic spinning areas. As result of this quarter, we identified and taken actions that should result in approximately $4 million a year savings. This does include the elimination of certain positions and the restructuring of some functions including IT as well as other non-personal relative reductions.

As communicated in our press release, given the actual third quarter results in our expectations for the fourth quarter we are adjusting both our revenue and diluted earnings per share guidance for fiscal year 2014.
For the full year we are reducing our revenue guidance by $100 million to a range of $2 billion to $2.05 billion and diluted earnings per share in the range of $79 to $82 per share. Thanks for your attention, and operator, we are now ready to take your questions.
Question-and-Answer Session 

Operator
Yes sir. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Larry Solow of CJS Securities. Your line is open.
Arnie Ursaner â CJS Securities, Inc.
Good afternoon, itâs actually Arnie Ursaner backing up Larry on the call. So I have a couple of quick questions for you. First on the financial side, you mentioned, last year you had an earn-out reduction or reversal if you will, was there any reversal this year in the SG&A line?
John C. Fortson
No, that was kind of one-off related to a transaction we did overseas, but we havenât done a similar type of adjustment this year.
Arnie Ursaner â CJS Securities, Inc.
Okay, whatâs your tax rate view for Q4?
John C. Fortson
We did have this one-time adjustment that we talked about in the press release, but our effective tax rate is going to remain at 34.5% going forward.
Arnie Ursaner â CJS Securities, Inc.
 
Okay. And obviously one of the positives and negatives ignored given the quarter is the fact that you signed on a huge number of very significant, very positive contracts. Can you speak about the working capital and overall investments the company will have to make to realize the benefit of some of these very attractive long-term plans?
John C. Fortson
Yes, so we have actually already started on the unnamed customer, we have obviously made investments and then weâve made some investments in advance for the Sabena transaction. When you look at this quarter, we actually did invest pretty heavily on our growth both for our sort of traditional transaction business, but also these programs to give you an idea, the order of magnitude and as you probably know, this doesnât really run through our CapEx line, but we spend about $27 million between the two between parts and engines over the course of this quarter.
So we are going to have to continue to make some investments, but we are going to sequence through them. We think these things give us the right returns going forward.
Arnie Ursaner â CJS Securities, Inc.
 
Thank you. I will jump back in queue. Thanks.

Julie A. Yates-Stewart â Credit Suisse Securities LLC
Good evening.
David P. Storch
Hi Julie.
John C. Fortson
Hi Julie.
Julie A. Yates-Stewart â Credit Suisse Securities LLC
Hi, so this is the second quarter really guys have lowered EPS guidance about 14% below where you started the year excluding the tax benefit. So as you are preparing to give guidance in July for FY 2015, what are you doing differently and how should we think about the level of visibility that you have and the confidence around FY 2015?
John C. Fortson
Well, I think first of all, I will get through FY 2014 and I think that we are trying to share with you that we are positioning ourselves with some of these new contract wins to give us a little bit more dependable revenue base if you will. This is an unusual period for us, because historically we have been able to replace business. I am not sure and I am trying to, I guess get a handle around the impact that the weather may have had in terms of disrupting some of our operations, because it was a little bit unusual in terms of not being able to win certain new businesses and that didnât happen should we typically would have won.

So I believe we have a fairly good visibility, fairly weâre disappointed here in terms of this quarterâs result, but yes, I think that as we come into July, we should have pretty good visibility.
Julie A. Yates-Stewart â Credit Suisse Securities LLC
Okay. And then David, last quarter I think you said that mobility products have reached kind of a steady state, it looks like itâs going to continue to be a bit soft here?
David P. Storch
No, this is purely compared to prior year and that they should have a very decent fourth quarter.
Julie A. Yates-Stewart â Credit Suisse Securities LLC
Okay. And then I recall last quarter you did talk about some of the weakness for the second half for the cash flow as youâve invested in some of these programsâ¦
David P. Storch
Right.

But this is obviously the weakest itâs been in eight quarters, you had a really good performance.
John C. Fortson
Right.
Julie A. Yates-Stewart â Credit Suisse Securities LLC
How should we think about cash flow in the fourth quarter and even any preliminary indications you can give on next year?
John C. Fortson
Weâre going to have some cash going out on the bounce of the Sabena deal. So I think as we ramp in some of these new contracts, there will be some cash going out. As I look out into next year assuming surely from standpoint of our existing customer, our existing business phase, Iâd expect our free cash to exceed our after-tax income. I expect to be over that 100% number that weâve experienced in the last eight quarters as you mentioned. So I think we should be generating some pretty good cash flow next year.
Julie A. Yates-Stewart â Credit Suisse Securities LLC

Okay. And then last one from me, any update on Lake Charles?
John C. Fortson
Yes, Lake Charles has been inactive of late. We completed the contracts that were there when we took on the business and now we are bidding work, but as we sit here today, we havenât had any success here, but I think everyday has to be just a little bit patient only because we just got the EASA certification in September and weâre trying to figure out how to go ahead and tie [ph] people there in a way that we can still make a buck on it.
So, be a little patient, look back on the Indianapolis now the first couple of years of our Indianapolis adventure, in our mostly even vacant eventually we got some business and weâve been able to grow from there. So, we still believe that we are positioned well there we just need a little bit more time to break into some accounts.
Julie A. Yates-Stewart â Credit Suisse Securities LLC
All right, thank you.
John C. Fortson
Yes.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Tyler Hojo of Sidoti & Company. Your line is open.
Tyler E. Hojo â Sidoti & Co. LLC
Yes, good evening. I want to ask you first about the NATO contract that was announced or the NATO weather of intent I should call it I guess, does the $27 million in working capital investment that was already NATO, does that include NATO as well?
John C. Fortson
No, it does not.
Tyler E. Hojo â Sidoti & Co. LLC
Okay, when does that start to hit?
John C. Fortson
Weâll start making investment in that this quarter.
Tyler E. Hojo â Sidoti & Co. LLC

Okay.
David P. Storch
And then weâll have, there will be a ramp in investment over the next two-year period as the EJs start coming into the fleet.
Tyler E. Hojo â Sidoti & Co. LLC
Okay, but even with that investment, do you think still think free cash flow in fiscal 2015 is going to exceed net income, is that correct?
John C. Fortson
Yes, yes.
Tyler E. Hojo â Sidoti & Co. LLC

Okay. All right, thanks for that clarification. And then, in regards to I think the $200 million contract value that you cited for me, how should we think about that ramping over the next 10, 12years?

John C. Fortson
So I believe they get to the 30 aircrafts in three years if Iâm not mistaken and so once we get to that point that should stay relatively constant. So, as the aircraft commence the fleet, the revenues kicks in, but once we get to the year three, the aircraft will be starting to require their C check as well. So, I would say probably will get to full ramp by year five would be my guess.
Tyler E. Hojo â Sidoti & Co. LLC

Okay.
David P. Storch
And youâll have the, aircraft would have been in service, all the aircrafts would have been in service and all the aircrafts would have been through at least one C check.
Tyler E. Hojo â Sidoti & Co. LLC
Okay, great. Thanks for that. And then, just some regards to the restructuring initiatives that were called out I believe the number of $4 million was drawn out in terms of the savings. Is there any expense associated with these restructuring initiatives thatâs included in the Q4 guidance?
John C. Fortson
There will be some and it is in the guidance, so obviously there will be some severance related to some people that will be departing the firm, but thatâs part of the bulk of it, but itâs in the guidance.
Tyler E. Hojo â Sidoti & Co. LLC
Okay. Can you call it out or just not going to?
John C. Fortson
Iâm rather not, butâ¦
Tyler E. Hojo â Sidoti & Co. LLC 
Okay. 
David P. Storch
Tyler if I may, let me go back to the question on Mesa for second and â the current agreement that Mesa has with the United Express is for 30 aircraft. I believe Mesa is optimistic as they perform and United Express grow their ERG fleet that though get more aircraft under their contracts. And so there might be a follow-on work there as well just kind of far that away if you donât mind.
Tyler E. Hojo â Sidoti & Co. LLC
Yes that will be great. Okay, may be one follow-on just in regards to Mesa, those of us that have followed the name for a long time remember the last Mesa contract and kind of how that was a bit painful back in 4 to 5 years ago or so. Is there anyway that you can protect yourself or is it just a function of â this is a better aircraft thatâs more in demand.
David P. Storch
I think thatâs the way to look at it. I believe and this contract we negotiate not just with Mesa but also with United. And United fairly in better shape today than they were letâs say last quarter around, so. Yes, my belief is that you have brand new equipment, the 70 seaters as opposed to the 50 seaters and our view is that we should be protected on the asset. And that, time will tell of course.
Tyler E. Hojo â Sidoti & Co. LLC
Okay, great. And just one last one for me if I may, just in regards to the tech product segment, really nice margin improvement sequentially in the quarter. And Iâm just kind of wondering how we should think about the movement in margin in that segment on a go-forward basis?
John C. Fortson
David mentioned that weâre expecting improvement that mobility in the fourth quarter and I think you should actually see more of the same as we go forward there.
Tyler E. Hojo â Sidoti & Co. LLC
Okay, great. Thatâs all I had. Thanks a lot.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin Ciabattoni of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Kevin Ciabattoni â KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.
Thanks, good afternoon, guys. First question, I guess on the NATO 18 contract, maybe some color on what might be holding up those initial task orders. I know youâd been modeling before this year. And then may be if you could talk about I have taken a number of kind of â what's the ramp for next year on that contract that you are kind of looking at, at this point?
David P. Storch
Yes. The NATO 18 contract was released, we were advised which aircraft we are going to get and then with the political turmoil and the elections and our governmentâs inability to work with Cargo just put everything on hold. We are hopeful that with the new government coming into Afghanistan that weâll start to see these aircrafts start to be activated, but I donât know if thatâs going to be in April or July or when so, itâs pretty tough to predict a ramp there and we havenât really been successful to-date on predicting when we think weâll kick in. 

In terms of next year, there is a series of opportunities some one we choosy and then one particular thatâs very, very large and I think we last quarter, called it a game changer and that would be pick most of next fiscal year to work through, get awarded and start to some of the place in it and quite frankly we havenât seen the final RP on that yet. 
So weâre looking to see some more aircraft come out of the portfolio as we go into fiscal 2015 and then start to put more aircraft in on these by winning some of these competitions that weâre getting today.
Kevin Ciabattoni â KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.
Great, thanks. You have had some nice wins in the supply chain business over the last few months, just wondering if you could talk about looking forward what the pipeline for that business looks like and maybe more specifically what you guys are seeing in terms of the potential for more of the programmatic wins which I know something you look to kind of ship that business towards?
David P. Storch
These things are the way of kind of building off each other, so weâre hopeful that by securing, there have been programs for instance that that will lead to additional business in that field, they could be, not investing in this business for the last few years. So on talking with the people and the business unit, we have a sense that we can possibly win some additional business in that region. 
So I think what I am trying to signal in my commentary was as a result some of these wins, the airline expandable win, the Eaton win, the Sabena win that there will be more of this kind of activity in each of those streams coming forward.
Kevin Ciabattoni â KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.
Okay, thanks. The supply chain contract in the quarter that you restructured from Time and Material to Power-by-the-Hour, what was the driver there for changing the structure of that contract, was that coming from you, from the customers, just kind of wondering what that played out?
David P. Storch
When we won that contract, you may recall there was an airline, there was a ex-airline maintenance base that was providing the maintenance and again this is one of those situations where weâre not supposed to be discussing who the airline is, by I will explain to you, you might be able to get to the conclusion, but basically the MRO disappointed the airline was when bankrupt and they had a design that were holding a fair amount of that airlines inventory. 
So there was no way to price power and they have been operating under power by our agreement, frequent price Power-by-the-Hour nor do they want us to, so we work on a Time and Material basis for year and so we project the Power-by-the-Hour agreement, so we could gain more knowledge and then negotiate Power-by-the-Hour agreement. So it was always intended to go Power-by-the-Hour, it was just a temporary experience to go Time and Material. So this is always planned in the process of going Power-by-the-Hour calls for, it drive the less revenue number, but the profitability is approximately the same.
Kevin Ciabattoni â KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.
Okay, thatâs helpful on that. I will jump back in queue.

Thank you. Our next question comes from J.B. Groh of D.A. Davidson. Your question please.
J.B. Groh â D.A. Davidson & Co.
Hey guys most of my questions have been answered. Can you may be lay out the timing in the cash flow bookings for that sale of the nine aircraft?
David P. Storch
Yes, I mean look they are available for sale now I donât know if we can give you a real prediction as to when we would expect this stock share to be sold, but some of them are back in the U.S., some of them are in transit back to the U.S. and then some of them are actually going to be moved to a location in the Middle East where we think we might have a better chance at marketing them. So we are pushing down hard to get something done this quarter, itâs not a uncertainty, but certainly over the next six months.

J.B. Groh â D.A. Davidson & Co.
Could you give us may be the book value alone or?
David P. Storch
Yes I mean the nine that we have for sale right now on the books for about $18.8 million.
J.B. Groh â D.A. Davidson & Co.
Okay and the price value would be above or below that?
David P. Storch
The expectation is to make a gain.
J.B. Groh â D.A. Davidson & Co.
Okay, good. Okay thank you.

Thank you. Our next question comes from [indiscernible]. Your question please.
Unidentified Analyst
Hi guys.
David P. Storch
Hi John.
Unidentified Analyst
Thanks for taking my questions, and most of them are answered. But so in at the early part what â could you give me a color on what drove the increase in SG&A as a percentage of sales that you went up by about 160 basis points?
David P. Storch
Well, okay. So, we talked about this a little bit, but yes itâs compared it on an apples-to apples-base shares, you have to make an adjustments the third quarter of last yearâs number because there was an acquisition adjustment made in that. So when you add back to last yearâs number, that sort of $9 million was part of that actually are SG&A itself by about $5 million.
Unidentified Analyst
Okay.
David P. Storch
Will provide and so adjustment numbers really a kind of one-off related.
Unidentified Analyst
Right.
David P. Storch
That particular deal.
Unidentified Analyst
For the most recent quarters SG&A figure is more in line?
David P. Storch
normalized.
Unidentified Analyst
Normalized okay?
David P. Storch
Correct.
Unidentified Analyst
And then in terms of your availability, liquidity under your revolvers whatâs the kind of estimated figure right now?
David P. Storch
So we have lots of liquidity, its a quarter close, weâve had close to $400 million available and thatâs prior to any incremental [indiscernible] or anything else.
Unidentified Analyst
Okay. So excluding the $115 million or so cash about $285 million and your revolver still there that level.
David P. Storch
Right.
Unidentified Analyst
Okay. Fine thatâs all I had and the rest were answered. Thank you.

Thank you (Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from Stan Mann Stan Mann of Mann Family. Your line is open.
Stan Mann â Mann Family Investments
Hi gentlemen, I have four quick questions for David.
David P. Storch
Yes go ahead Stan.
Stan Mann â Mann Family Investments
Question one, any effect that you foresee in the near-term or far-term on the American Airline merger been effecting there?
David P. Storch
No I mean itâs kind of, we are making â there is a progress and we will keep working it.
Stan Mann â Mann Family Investments
Okay so there is nothing specific or that we can expect?
David P. Storch
Nothing that I see at this moment, but we continue to work it.
Stan Mann â Mann Family Investments
Okay. Two, looking forward couple of several years how do you feel about top-line growth, I mean this quarter was weak, but what do you see looking down the road, I mean how is your feel?
David P. Storch
So assuming that the general economy were to grow at like call it for argument sake 3%, I would expect our growth rate to be around 10%.
Stan Mann â Mann Family Investments
Okay, and whatâs the positive view? very positive.
David P. Storch
Yes.
Stan Mann â Mann Family Investments
Okay three, there is a little bit more complicated, you are moving into Europe with Sabena deal, thatâs correct?
David P. Storch
I wonât say moving into Europe, we have been in Europe, I think weâre kind of in a â kind of increasing our investments in Europe, yeah.
Stan Mann â Mann Family Investments
Okay, well thank the every other companies that does international business favor that I follow has a much lower tax rate and takes advantage of the geographic move for taxes. Your tax rate is inordinately high for a corporation that has international exposure. So, can I ask you think that we might get a base in Ireland or something that will give us the ability to drop our tax rate?

David P. Storch
Let them kind of play around with that and let us give some thoughts to that, before we comment and then get back to you on that, because we didnât make this acquisition with that mine, but clearly we have actually in the aviation where the fair amount of fall through based in Dublin for that purpose. So let us kind a play around and see if thatâs an option for us. We have much thoughts about we donât really know at this stage as that meaningful for us.
Now let me, let me add to that, although the operations is headquartered in Brussels keep in mind now also one of the motivation is to increase our Middle East and Africa business where fleet sizes are grown.
Stan Mann â Mann Family Investments
Rapidly.
David P. Storch
Yes, yes, yes.
Stan Mann â Mann Family Investments
But the tax question, the tax question is legitimate and substantial. And I want to be there your legal, your high relative to anybody doing business internationally. And of the interest in area for bottom line?
David P. Storch
But we will take that constructively and let us do the work on that and then weâll let you know, okay.
Stan Mann â Mann Family Investments
I have one last question, in any area of your business, did you have liquidity? Do you sense or are you working on or do you see the possibility of starting acquisition program again, which is kind of delayed for a while?
David P. Storch
So, we didnât delay it for any real reasonably, weâve still been looking or thinking about acquisitions, we know feel a lot more courageous today with the stronger balance sheet position and we do see some opportunities obviously my preference is to grow organically and I think in this quarter although we kind of didnât perform from sales standpoint we did perform from the standpoint of winning some new business contracts.
So my preference would be organic growth and we will look to supplement that organic growth with what we considered to be appropriate acquisitions. We do have a couple of one acquisition in particular which will give us one acquisition [indiscernible] I should say, which should give us some additional possibilities for a new revenue stream and we are looking at that situation very closely to that.
Stan Mann â Mann Family Investments
Okay. Youâve been very successful in opportunistic acquisition thatâs why I asked for a question.
David P. Storch
Thank you.
Stan Mann â Mann Family Investments
But anyway, thank you very much.
David P. Storch

Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to AAR's fiscal 2014 fourth quarter and yearned earnings call.
Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that the comments made during this call may include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 as noted in our news release and our Risk Factor section of the company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2013. In providing forward-looking statements, the company assumes no obligation to provide updates to reflect future circumstances or anticipated or unanticipated events.
At this time, I would like to turn the call over to AAR's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, David Storch.
David Storch
Hi, thank you very much, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for joining us today to discuss our fourth quarter and fiscal 2014 yearend results. We will also provide some guidance and expectations for our fiscal year 2015 with a little color. And I'm here in suburbs of Chicago, joined by Tim Romenesko, our Chief Operating Officer; John Fortson, our Chief Financial Officer; Mike Sharp, our Chief Accounting Officer and Controller.
Just to reiterate some of the highlights from the quarter. Sales were $505 million, although down from prior year, up from prior quarter. Sales in the Aviation Service segment were lower, primarily due to the softness in MRO and airlift, so we had fewer positions in the airlift operation, and MRO just went through some seasonality issues with certain customers. We haven't lost that business, just less demand during the period.
Our supply chain business had a lot of momentum, had a good quarter, and goes into the new year with a strong backlog and a lot of exciting things going on. Technology Products, we had softer commercial sales largely due to fewer 747-8 systems, but we did experience defense growth with A400M system sales.
Our operating income in the quarter was $33 million. Net earnings for the quarter were $0.43, which was higher than the latest consensus and higher than what we reported for fiscal year 2013 or the prior year's quarter.
For the full year, sales were $2.04 billion, which would be a decrease of just under 5% for the year. Operating income was $146 million with slightly better margin, [7.2%] than prior-year performance. We reported diluted earnings per share of $1.83, ahead of the $1.81 consensus expectation, and this compares to the $1.38 reported for fiscal year 2013.
As we look back at the year, it is important to point out that we also generated significant cash flow, so we had cash flow from operations of $140 million and free cash flow of $113 million, which equates to the $2.90 per share.
With that cash, we paid some dividends and we further reduced our net debt position. I should add that we made significant investments. Net of that, we made significant investments supporting the growth in our supply chain businesses.
As I move over to Aviation Services, in our fourth quarter, sales were down 10% versus prior year. Supply chain had strong performance, starting to see the benefits of investments we made throughout the year and the positive impact on new programs.
Today, we are fully operational on our supply chain hub in Brussels, and we continue to expand our reach across the series of new clients. We expect meaningful growth from these programs with supply chain having won an aggregate value of $1.9 billion of new contracts during the fiscal year that will be realized over the life of the program.

Some of the programs are five years in duration, some are 10, some are 12, but clearly this is a newer trend for the company. Historically, our supply chain businesses had a shorter window. Today, we're signing not just shorter deals, but also more longer deals in our effort to become more integral to our customersâ operations.
In MRO, sales for the quarter were down, driven primarily by cyclical downturn in our landing gear business, and wind down of meaningful engineering service contracts. You might recall that engineering service business, where we have a crackerjack team and capability in place is very deal-sensitive.
So, if we get a deal, it's great business. When you don't get a deal, it's not as good. But when we do comparatives on a year-over-year basis, last year we had a very appealing deal with North American carrier, and this year we didn't have that business. So those guys are knocking on doors, and I'm sure they'll have successes to report during this current fiscal year.
To counter some of the headwinds that we have experienced, we've refocused our MRO leadership to exploit the advantages of our one MRO strategy, and to aggressively pursue business opportunities with new customers and for wide-body airframes. We're proud to complete our first 777 work, which we performed on behalf of Aeromexico, who we also did 767 work for as well.
So, although sales were down in the period, we have taken steps to improve that performance, and I think as this year unfolds, when you look at the back half of the year, we're fully sold-out in our MRO shop, and we do expect the turnarounds in our landing gear operation as the gear repair cycle kicks in.
Airlift continues to transition new opportunities as we discussed at the beginning of fiscal year 2014 with 40 flying aircraft positions. We ended the year with 20, which was three lower than we guided last quarter. Airlift did a good job reducing costs and finding efficiencies throughout the year to reflect this new environment and came in with excellent operating margins.
For fiscal year 2015, we anticipate the positions will trough in Q1, and that's where we got down to 17 in June, but will increase its previously awarded positions to come on line. We expect to finish the year with 28 positions operating.
Let me now turn to Technology Products. Sales in this segment were down 4%, driven primarily by softer demand for the commercial cargo products. Mobility products actually had a strong quarter and performed better than last year, with higher sales for the quarter than prior-year period. However, commercial cargo had lower sales than expected due to reduced 747-8 cargo systems demand from Boeing and lower spare sales.
Going into fiscal year 2015, we expect commercial cargo to transition, to increase production as the A320 and the A350s ramp. So, we are exclusive on both of those models. We will also be a beneficiary of the A330, where we sell systems between $350,000 and $450,000 per shipset. And as many of you saw on Monday, Airbus announced their intentions to create an A330neo, which will keep that aircraft operating or on the production line for at least another 10 years.
In closing, as we move into our new fiscal year, we will continue to focus on execution, finding growth opportunities, improving our performance and margins, while delivering higher levels of cash generation.
So let me do this at this moment. Let me turn the call over to John, who will fill you in on some of the financials, and then will circle back to me for closing comments.
John Fortson
Thanks David. I trust that each of you had a chance to read our earnings release, which was posted yesterday afternoon. On this call, I'd like to review a few key points with regards to our performance.

We improved our consolidated gross profit margin in the fourth quarter to 17% from the adjusted 16.3% in the prior-year period. This performance translated into a 16.8% margin for Aviation Services and a 17.6% margin for Technology Products.
SG&A as a percentage of sales in the fourth quarter was 10.5%. This is higher than last few quarters due to higher compensation expenses this quarter. I would like to note that we expect in FY '15 for these margins to improve on a year-on-year basis going forward, as our cost control initiatives continue. Our operating margin for the year was 7.2%.
During the fourth quarter, we generated $63.1 million in cash from operations and our capital expenditures were $5.3 million. We are very focused on receivables management and cash collection. We continue to delever and reduce our net indebtedness by further $89 million from the prior year, ending the year with total debt of $634 million and net debt of $545 million.
Our net debt-to-EBITDA is currently at 2.3x, down from 2.6x a year ago and 3.2x at the end of fiscal year '12. This is within the range we have set ourselves as a target of 2x to 2.5x.
Net interest expense for the fourth quarter declined to $9.1 million. Our net interest expense numbers continue to decline, as we focus on paying down debt. Depreciation and amortization, including amortization stock-based compensation, was $23.6 million during the fourth quarter.
For fiscal year 2014, our effective tax rate was 30.5%. For fiscal year 2015, we are anticipating this rate to be 32.7%. This is a change from the 34.5% we historically guided people to for planning purposes and reflect increased utilization of tax credits.
We are analyzing our tax position carefully, and after reviewing our tax obligations over the last five years, we feel comfortable in guiding to this rate of 32.7%. We enter fiscal 2015 with 39.1 million shares in the diluted share count.
David discussed our anticipated schedule of aircraft positions over the next year in airlift, but I would also note that we now have 12 aircraft available for sale, which is up from nine at the end of last quarter with a combined book value of over $33 million. We continue to analyze the portfolio and may consider adding more aircraft to this list, if the situation warrants.
Our after-tax ROIC for the year was 6.1%. In fiscal year 2015, we are adjusting management's compensation plan to include ROIC as a performance metric in the company's long-term incentive plan. ROIC is being used by our business units to mange their businesses for a long time.
We believe it is an important return metric that we can use a corporate to drive performance and we'll be monitoring it closely going forward and seeking to improvement. There are a few businesses that have been a drag on this corporate rate and we are now dedicating effort to improve these, as we have finished our deleveraging.
Thank you for your attention. And I will now turn the call back over to David for some closing comments.
David Storch
Let me just add a little bit to that. As John has alluded, our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio has come down from a peak of 3.2x down to 2.3x. Another way of looking at it, we had actually peaked net debt at about $805 million after we closed on Telair and Nordisk acquisitions, and today we're at net debt of $545 million. So we've had meaningful reductions.
In the two fiscal years, we've gone from $750 million-ish to $545 million. So we've taken $200 million of debt or capital off the business. So we're very pleased with that. And we think we put ourselves into an appealing leverage ratio, which now causes us to look at things and focus on those businesses that are performing and those businesses that are underperforming.
We've had a couple of underperforming businesses, which have been a drag on our return calculations. And I just want to state that before this year is out, we will take actions with these businesses that will lead to a positive impact on how we give returns on the capital that you've entrusted us with to manage on your behalf.

So let me move on and conclude with our guidance for fiscal year 2015. As stated in our press release, we currently expect sales in the range of $2.100 billion to $2.150 billion. Aviation Services, we expect to see strong growth in our supply chain business and improve our opportunities in MRO.
We also except the airlift to have some puts and takes, as it evolves, both losing some existing positions, but gaining others. And you please have comfort in knowing that we've had very appealing, very attractive returns from this business, and this business has been a very positive cash generator for the company.
In our Technology Product business, we do expect the ramp of shipments on the A400M, cargo loading system and improvement in commercial cargo, as a result of A320 and A350 deliveries. And our mobility business will continue to experience some softness, as military budgets remain under pressure. And taking a look around the world and looking at so many unsettling situations, we won't be surprised that at some point the mobility business gets a call to action and sees an up tick in its activity.
I should also just comment on the fact that this business is still a leader, has a leadership position in its market niche, and we've seen operating income in that business that has been the $75 million range. Today we're operating in the $20 million range. So you can see we've had a significant fall-off in demand, but we still maintain a leadership position in that market in exclusive on many of the products that we do deliver for the DoD.
We anticipate full year diluted earnings per share in the $1.80 to $1.90 range. And our customer schedule for heavy maintenance business is light during the first quarter, but increases significantly in the second half of the fiscal year to the point where most of our facilities are sold-out for the second half of the year.
Because of this and the positioning schedule, our aircraft portfolio, we do anticipate the first quarter will be a little softer than other quarters of this year. And we always like to stay away from hockey stick approaches, but the reality is we do have some seasonality to our businesses and this is how we look to the businesses unfolding for the year.
In closing, I would want to reiterate the strengths and the performance of the company during the year in terms of the cash flow generation, and I would encourage investors to look at this indicator as a sign of strength coming from the company.
So with that, I'll close my comments and open up the phones for any questions you might have.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Larry Solow with CJS Securities.
Larry Solow - CJS Securities
Just a few questions. We've spoken a lot about the ramping of several contracts in the supply chain. Perhaps you could just sort of review where we stand, some of the major ones, I guess, Unison, is that fully ramped? And how is the Eaton deal going? And then also probably, just new consumable parts contract that you announced last quarter?
Timothy Romenesko
So yes, the consumable program is still ramping. We're working aggressively to setup a new distribution center in Indianapolis to support that program. So, it will probably take us a few more months, I would say, to get the full ramp. The Unison transaction is going as we had anticipated in accordance with our schedule. And then on Eaton, we're continuing to ramp that program, and we see additional opportunities to grow that product line. We've had a tremendous amount of success in this piece of our business. We're digesting some of the volumes, but we see significant new opportunities here.
David Storch
Larry, let me add also that the investments that we've made in the Brussels operation is leading to deals flow coming out of European customers and Middle East customers that we have not seen before. So, the team is aggressively pursuing that market in a way that we didn't really have the capability or visibility in the past.

Larry Solow - CJS Securities
And then on the airlift business, the projection for 28 aircraft being utilized at yearend, does that assume most are out of Afghanistan except for the -- I guess, there are some from this new contract you announced last year. And I realized there's some uncertainties, but are you assuming or is this 28 based on sort of ongoing discussions or what you sort of have believed to be in-hand today or do you assume that you'll get new contracts?
John Fortson
These assumptions are based on our contract positions in Afghanistan as well as previously announced contract positions both in Afghanistan for NATO, but also incremental positions in Africa that we've already been awarded, Larry. Of the 28, four are what I would call sort of new business, right. The rest are already awarded positions that we're expecting the contracts to get turned on.
Larry Solow - CJS Securities
And then just calling on David's comment about some of the underperforming businesses, can we expect a potential sale of some of these things to improve? Are you expecting â are there initiatives out there that you expect to sort of improve operations which will help returns?
David Storch
Larry, let me just say that by the end of the year that we will have these -- our intention is to have these problems solved.
Larry Solow - CJS Securities
On cash flow, another fabulous year in terms of cash flow. Is that a sustainable number? What's the outlook for that in '15?
David Storch
So, we're looking at directionally in a similar way as we experienced last couple of years, but we do anticipate some investments in the supply chain business, which might not allow us to hit quite the same level as we had this year, but we expect it to be strong.
Operator
Our next question comes from Julie Yates with Credit Suisse.
Unidentified Analyst
This is actually [ph] Krishna, her associate. Julie is on a flight right now. But just wanted to ask, if you could give a bit more color on your '15 guidance, I was just wondering where do you guys see some potential for upside to that and potentially even where do you guys see some risks?
David Storch
So yes, I think we see potential for upside in the supply chain. We've been putting pressure on the supply chain group to grow its earnings at a faster clip than they submitted, let's say, and the deal flow seems to be pretty robust. We are not calculating in any significant deals in that number. So, if we do have a deal or two which -- and they are out there that would have a positive impact on our results.
Operator
The next question comes from Kevin Ciabattoni with KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Kevin Ciabattoni - KeyBanc Capital Markets
Looking at the guidance for '15, just wondering if you could give us some color on maybe some of the margin headwind versus '14, is that just a matter of mix with airlift positions coming out? Any color you could give there would help?
John Fortson
Kevin, that's an accurate read. I mean I think really you've got -- we do have a sales and a margin mix shift going on a little bit, and so as airlift comes down, obviously that puts some downward pressure, and as the supply chain businesses sort of kick in, they have to kind of continue to produce volume to get the margins kind of back up. So that's kind of what's happening there.
Kevin Ciabattoni - KeyBanc Capital Markets
And then, just following up on Larry's airlift question, can you, John, maybe tell us how many positions do you have baked in for that NATO 18 contract? And then also what you guys have baked in in terms of the asset sales for next year?
John Fortson
So we have four NATO positions that we've been awarded. We're just waiting for the go-ahead, and I think part of that is waiting on the services agreement to be signed between the countries. In terms of baked into the plans for sales, I think we have a few, but not the full complement of aircrafts that are for sale.

Kevin Ciabattoni - KeyBanc Capital Markets
Last one from me. Last couple of quarters, you guys have given the billable hours in the quarter. I was just wondering if you could give us that for 4Q and maybe that comp for last year?
John Fortson
Yes, just hang on a sec here. I got so many pages in front of me. So, our billable hours over the last 12 months, we sold over 5 million, 5.035 million hours of work sold, right. That's a production efficiency of a 107%. We worked on 1,082 aircrafts.
Kevin Ciabattoni - KeyBanc Capital Markets
Do you have the fourth quarter number, if any John?
John Fortson
Fourth quarter, we sold 1,218,000. The production efficiency just so you know is 111%, so it was good.
Operator
Our next question comes from J.B. Groh with D.A. Davidson.
Alex Heinen - D.A. Davidson
This is Alex Heinen on for J.B. today. So just a follow-up question on the MRO business here, you know you said that you were seeing a bit of cyclical downturn in the landing gear business and maybe some seasonality kind of washed into this quarter. Do you expect that to kind of go away starting in Q1 or should we see maybe a slow ramp backup from the space going forward?
Timothy Romenesko
So we see the summer is actually the toughest month in the hangers. All of the operators want to have their fleet deployed as much as they possibly can. So we see that the aircraft starting to come back into the hangers' kind of mid-second quarter and then ramping up through the balance of the fiscal year.
Also in the September, October timeframe we have access to an additional hanger in Lake Charles. We have some good customer interest in that. So that also contributes to kind of our optimism for the second half of the fiscal year. And we are training our workforce now in anticipation of some of the work that we have scheduled for Lake Charles. And so we are optimistic that it's going to turn into a successful operation.
Operator
Our next question comes from Stan Manne with Manne Family Investments.
Stan Manne - Manne Family Investments
A prime question I have is on your expectations for use of cash in 2015. You did mentioned debt reduction, but what about M&A possibilities?
David Storch
Yes. So the M&A pipeline is fairly robust for us at this stage. We do feel pretty good about our ratios and financial position today. So we may be looking for ways to strengthen our supply chain business during the upcoming period.
Stan Manne - Manne Family Investments
But you do have opportunities or targets that exists?
David Storch
We do.
Stan Manne - Manne Family Investments
You mentioned, kind of obliquely, the possible sale of any of your businesses, is that something?
David Storch
Let's stand to be more precise, so I have indicated is that we had certain underperforming business that we will solve this fiscal year.
Stan Manne - Manne Family Investments
So that means you possibly could have operating margin improvement?
David Storch
Yes.
Operator
Our next question is a follow-up question from Larry Solow with CJS Securities.
Larry Solow - CJS Securities
Just a couple of quickies on the trading, the parts business, what's the recent trends, pricing been in that piece?
David Storch
I would say, fairly consistent with historical pricing. It's steady and it's been pretty decent for us. We are seeing our returns improved in that business and we anticipate our returns will continue to improve in that business. The market is fairly bullish. It's a fairly positive market environment for that business today.
Larry Solow - CJS Securities
Right.
David Storch
I think we have done some smart things in positioning the company in a more international way.
Larry Solow - CJS Securities
And then you touched on the Lake Charles. I think it's just starting to ramp, and I guess part of the increased focus is on the wide-body, is that supported by Lake Charles?

Timothy Romenesko
Yes, Larry, it's Tim. Yes, it is. That would be kind of our main wide-body operation. We have a couple of aircraft in there now. But we do expect the Lake Charles facility to be busy as we get into the second half of the fiscal year.
Larry Solow - CJS Securities
And you expect that to be profitable this year for the full year?
Timothy Romenesko
We do.
Larry Solow - CJS Securities
Great.
Timothy Romenesko
We do. But we also do wide-body in other places in our network, but Lake Charles will be well-suited for it.
Larry Solow - CJS Securities
And then just last one, on the tax rate. I like the position there with the 32.7%. Is that ballpark, is that lower number, maybe not exactly that, but is that a sustainable number going forward or do you have something?
Timothy Romenesko
We went back, Larry, and we actually went back more than five years, but if you look back over the last five years, we feel that that's a comfortable rate that we sort of have achieved year-on-year. I mean, when you look specifically at what we're looking at for next year, it kind of triangulates in.
Larry Solow - CJS Securities
And then, but going out in the out years, is it hard to say?
Timothy Romenesko
I think, if history is any indictor, we think that's a good number.
Operator
And I am not showing any further questions at this time.
David Storch
Well, thank you for your participation today. And hopefully everybody has a nice day and including our share price.

Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the AARâs Fiscal 2015, First Quarter Earnings Call. 
Before we begin, Iâd like to remind you that comments made during the call may include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. As noted in our news release and the Risk Factors section of the company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2014. In providing forward-looking statements, the company assumes no obligations to provide updates or reflect future circumstances or anticipated or unanticipated events.
At this time Iâd like to turn the call over to AAR's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, David Storch.
David Storch 
Thank you, sir, and Iâd like to welcome all participants and say I hope you are having a nice day. Thank you for joining us for todayâs discussion of our fiscal 2015 first quarter results. We are here in Wood Dale, Illinois. Iâm joined by Tim Romenesko, our Chief Operating Officer; John Fortson, our Chief Financial Officer; and Mike Sharp, our Chief Accounting Officer.
Just to share some of the highlights from the quarter, as we indicated sales were down in both of our segments. Sales in our Aviation Service segment were lower, primarily due to the softness in our airlift operations and lower engineering activity in our airframe repair facilities.
However, I would like to point out supply chain sales to commercial and defense customers increased about approximately 20% during the period and we had growth in both, to the commercial markets and to the defense markets. We continue to build on our industry leading positions in this business and in addition we had success extending our operations internationally with our new operations in Brussels. 
In the Technology Product segment, lower sales of mobility products contributed to the sales decline. 
So consolidated sales, to commercial customers across the board increased by 2.4% and now represent 65% of our total revenue. Consolidated sales to the government defense customers decreased by 24% from the prior year period. But what Iâd like to share with you is kind of an overview of how we look at our government defense businesses and we really think of it in three buckets. Bucket one would be fleet sustainment. This would be characterized by supply chain and maintenance activity and in this piece of our defense business we did see growth in the period. 
New production, we benefited from the increased production of the A400M cargo systems and lastly our businesses tied to the operational tempo that suffered declines and principally that group of defense business is made up of our mobility and airlift businesses and they are tied to the activity, principally in theaters such as Afghanistan and the Middle East.
In Aviation Services, sales in the first quarter were down 8% versus prior year and despite the overall lowers sales for the segment, our commercial and defense supply chain operations performed well in the quarter and as mentioned, sales were up 20% and we also saw an improvement in operating margins, an improvement by 300 basis points and as weâve shared in prior communications, we have an enhanced focus on return on invested capital and in this group of businesses we saw 400 basis point improvement. 
The business continues to gain momentum with our expanded partnerships, most recently with Eaton and we also have kicked off some of the supply chain programs supporting airlines that weâve discussed, as well as new government support programs. And as I indicated earlier, our Brussels facility allows us to expand our reach deeper into Europe, Middle East and Africa. 

Airframe repair this quarter had a tough comparable period due to the sale of an aircraft last year that ran through our maintenance facilities, as well as the slightly slower summer than we had seen in the past. To give you a sense, we had an average about 42, not bad. We have an average of 42 aircrafts in our hangers during the summer and to give you a sense as to the trend, today we have 55 aircrafts in our facilities and are expecting a nice rebound in Q2.
As mentioned in our release, we were awarded two new contracts with two major U.S. carriers for narrow and wide body maintenance work to perform at our Lake Charles facility.
So our Lake Charles facility, you may recall a year ago we signed the leases. We commenced work roughly less than a year ago and business has been operating at a deficit and we expect with some of the new wins here that that business will start operating profitably here very soon, and if you liken it to our experience with Indianapolis, it took us a good year and a half in Indianapolis before we could start getting a decent return on that facility.
As for airlift, the business is down significantly from last year. Last year at this time we had 40 operating positions and you may recall we were experiencing excellent operational performance. This year still experiencing excellent operating performance, however we are down to 19 aircraft positions. 
We are working hard at transitioning the aircraft that came out of Afghanistan and you may note that weâve had some recent wins in Africa, both for rotary wing aircraft, as well as fixed wing aircraft. Unfortunately the implementation of these contracts were delayed due to protest by the incumbent, but those protests have since cleared in our favor and the work begins in November 1 for one of the contracts and December 1 for the other contract. 
We are also bidding. I think we have discussed in the past, we are also bidding on a very large state department contract of this business and weâll have a sense as to whether weâre successful or not in the January, February timeframe. 
As for technology products, here sales were down 13%, driven predominately by softer demand for mobility products. You may have caught recently that weâve formed a cargo group, which includes the acquired Telair and Nordisk businesses with the AAR cargo business. That group has been performing quiet well of late; however, in this period we have a slight reduction in sales due to Boeingâs reduction of 747-8 production line. 
We do expect cargo systems to ramp as the year progresses and Airbus starts delivery of the A350s. We are the cargo system provider on that aircraft and our content is worth approximately 400,000 per ship and keep in mind, thereâs over 750 orders for that aircraft.
So if I may at this stage, what Iâd like to do is turn the call over to John to fill you in on some of the financial details. 
John Fortson
Thanks David. I trust that each of you have had a chance to read our earnings release. On this call I'd like to review a few key points with regard to our performance.
Our consolidated gross profit margin in the first quarter was 16%, down from a 16.5% in the prior year period. This performance translated into a 16.3% margin for Aviation Services and a 15.3% for Technology Products.
SG&A as a percentage of sales in the first quarter was 9.6%, slightly higher than the 9.3% in the prior year period. SG&A expense however declined $2.8 million over the prior year period, reflecting continued cost control efforts, but increased slightly as a percentage of sales. 
Our operating margin for the quarter was 6.6%. Our margins were negatively impacted by the reduced contribution of airlift.
During the fourth quarter we generated $15 million of cash from operations and our capital expenditures were $9 million. We paid out $0.075 per share in dividends this quarter as well. 

We continue to focus on balance sheet management. As you may have seen, we initiated the process to call $30 million of our 1.625% convertible notes due in February. We hope to conclude this exercise in the early part of October. 
Net interest expense for the fourth quarter declined to $9.5 million from $10.8 million in the prior year. Our net interest expense numbers continue to decline with focus on paying down debt. Depreciation and amortization, including amortization of stock-based compensation, was $91 million during the first quarter.
For the first quarter in this fiscal year, our effective tax rate was 32.7% per our guidance in July. We expect this to be the rate for the remainder of the fiscal year and we ended the quarter with 39.2 million shares in the diluted share count. 
As noted in the earnings press release, we are also revising our earnings guidance. Our previous earnings guidance included assumptions on a number and mix of contracted airlift positions that have yet to materialize due to the political uncertainty in Afghanistan. Therefore we are lowering our earnings per share guidance from a range of $1.80 to $1.90 to a range of $1.65 to $1.75, and our sales guidance from a range of $2.1 billion to $2.15 billion to a range of $2 billion to $2.05 billion.
Thank you for your attention and I will now turn the call back over to David.
David Storch
Thanks John. Just in summary, we tried to capture it in the earnings release as well, is that you know our supply chain businesses are performing very well. MRO had a tough Q1, but we expect recovery in Q2 through Q4. As a matter of fact we are looking for improvement on a year-over-year basis for those businesses.
One of the things Iâd like to stress in supply chain is, we do see strength both from the commercial and defense side of that business and in total we see those businesses as I said, performing quite well. 
Unfortunately the drop off in business in airlift has come as a faster clip than we had hoped for. I still have a high level of confidence in the team we have in place and the opportunity pool that we are looking at for that business. But we are at this stage, based on what we know, and you may recall in the past weâve announced a contract award that was refereed to as NATO 18. Although weâre the successful contract winner, we have yet to receive any task orders and as we sit here today we have a high enough level of uncertainty that weâve chosen to reduce our forecast for this type of activity. 
So I think itâs a prudent thing to do at this stage. We still feel very good about our businesses and our position. We still maintain leadership positions in everything that we do and weâll continue to stay very focused on taking market share, generating cash and giving a good account for ourselves and a good return to our share holders.
We also continue looking at underperforming businesses. We still have a couple of those and as I committed at the last conference call, we will have action against those businesses before the fiscal year is out. 
So with that, what Iâd like to do is open up the call for any questions that you may have at this stage.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
(Operator Instructions). First question is from Larry Solow of CJS Securities. Your line is open.
Larry Solow - CJS Securities
Hi, good afternoon David. Could you maybe just discuss just a little bit on airlift and then mobility. Airlift, everything actually you say is qualitatively in line. It sounds like commercial is humming along as you expected and improving. I think that the one question I have is, does airlift â could it stay at these levels or even go lower. Does that take a couple of years to play itself out and then on mobility, has that taken another a little bit of a lag down or is it sort of just balancing on the bottom?

David Storch
Yes, so the airlift has probably taken a little bit further move down, not meaningfully as it has say last year over the prior year, but it continues to be challenged as it relates to airlift. Itâs a little unpredictable at this stage, because we are responding to a fair amount of our Qs and I still remain relatively optimistic that we can have nice successful performance coming out of the business. 
But keep in mind Larry, last year this quarter and last year the performance was exceptional and we would need more positions to go. Weâd have to get a tremendous increase in usage to approximate last yearâs performance. So we are not counting on last yearâs performance to be duplicated, but we do see in the - we see next quarter also or the quarter that we are currently in being a little tough, because the actual positions, we were hopeful we were awarded those in the last fiscal year. We were hopeful that that work would have kicked in in Q1; it didnât because of the protest. 
As I indicated the protest has been cleared, but the work doesnât begin until November 1 on one of the contracts and December on the other contract. So as we sit here planning right now, we are thinking Q2 is kind of the trough period and that we start seeing an uptick in Q3 and Q4. 
Larry Solow - CJS Securities
And my concern actually is I realize that the near term is, with these just placed on, itâs not easy to â with delays as well. Just as you look out two, three years you mentioned the state department contract, which I imagine is â I donât know if you can help us on size with that one, but are you bidding. I know that there are other opportunities that you discussed in the past more globally, but are you attempting to get into those areas as Afghanistan. Even best case you will still have several aircraft to utilize. 
David Storch
Yes, so we see opportunity. We see the Africa market expanding, so we see opportunities there. We see more opportunities around supporting the navy and we will be deploying some assets for additional navy contracts here shortly. So yes, I think we see a nice pool of opportunities. 
Of course, you know weâve had a fair amount of aircraft come back at us. So some that we didnât expect and some that we did expect, but yes, I think the team is looking at quite a few opportunities. The state department opportunity is very sizable and hopefully weâll give a good accounting for ourselves in this bidding process. 
But you know of course on that one itâs the winner takes it all. You either win it or you donât and if we win it its pretty and if you donât win it, itâs not. 
Larry Solow - CJS Securities
Right, I guess thatâs why I guess you got to try multiple shots on goal. I guess some of them hopefully reach the net.
David Storch
Thatâs exactly right. So we are out there, the guys are slugging away. Just to be clear, still a profitable business and still making nice contributions, just not the levels it has in the past and itâs hard to for us to make up for the dip across our businesses, although we did to some extent. 
Larry Solow - CJS Securities
Right, and just one quickly if I may. Just on the expanded Eaton deal, you said it should ramp within about a year. So it actually seems pretty fast. Is this deal similar in size to the one you did on the defense side with them? Is it a similar type arrangement and how is that ramping? 
David Storch
Yes, itâs a smaller transaction. Itâs a different customer base, but itâs a nice piece of business. It leverages our relationships there and it will ramp here fairly quickly.
Larry Solow - CJS Securities
Got you, great. Thanks. 
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Tyler Hojo of Sidoti & Company. Your line is open. 
Tyler Hojo - Sidoti & Company
Yes, hi. Good evening everyone. 

David Storch
Hi Tyler.
Tyler Hojo - Sidoti & Company
Hi. So just going back to Airlift for a second, could you help us a little bit in terms of sizing that business today in terms of revenues? And Iâm also kind of kind of curious; I guess weâve got 19 positions today. What is the expectation for guidance? Is it that 19 positions remains stable or does it go up or down from there. 
David Storch
So we are thinking that the low point is this quarter in the 19 range. We may come off a couple here in November and then we replace with others elsewhere. So we have a few more coming back from Afghanistan, but then we have a few going out to Africa, but we are expecting by Q3 to be at 23 aircraft. 
Tyler Hojo - Sidoti & Company
23 aircrafts, okay, great. And then just as kind of this airlift relates to the overall business, I think historically speaking Q1 has been your weakest quarter, but with this airlift dynamic, is Q2 expected to be down sequentially in terms of earnings?
David Storch
No, we are looking at the Q2 being relatively flat with Q1 is how we are seeing it. 
Tyler Hojo - Sidoti & Company
Okay, great. And maybe just transitioning over to MRO, certainly nice to hear about the progress at St. Charles. Maybe David you could provide a little bit of commentary as to kind of where utilization is with the wins and where utilization needs to be or needs to go to in order to kind of make some of those ROIC bogies that youâve set for yourself. 
David Storch
So as we are sitting here today, we are strong in Oklahoma, Duluth, Miami and Indianapolis. We have a room for improvement at Lake Charles and in Hot Springs.
Tyler Hojo - Sidoti & Company
Okay, and in terms of timing on Lake Charles. Did these wins kind of get you to where you want to be or do you need to kind of win some more to kind of fill it to a more steady state level. 
David Storch
Yes, Tim maybe you can answer that.
Tim Romenesko
So Lake Charles is in good shape in terms of our outlook and our commitments from our customers. What we are doing there is some of the work that we are doing now is lighter hours as we kind of get our [burn in] [ph] set and then as we go into the second half of the fiscal year with additional aircraft that come on with heavier manpower utilization, then weâll see that ramp up more significantly. But in terms of actual iron in the facility, we are in good shape. Itâs just that the hours that we are working on them now are light compared to some of the other facilities. 
Tyler Hojo - Sidoti & Company
Yes, thatâs great to hear. Actually just one follow-up going back to airlift, how many aircrafts are currently available for sale there and I guess Iâm just kind of curious on your perspective in regards to how those assets are being received in the market place? Are they desirable aircraft or are you getting pushed back? 
David Storch
So there are 15 aircraft that we have determined are for sale. Those aircrafts are for the most part fairly niche oriented aircraft. So itâs the type of asset that if you have the right asset when somebody needs it, itâs very valuable and weâve had a series of discussions with perspective customers. Weâve got to do a better job on remarketing. 
The team has been very focused on repositioning aircraft into different theaters, but we are in the process of trying to onboard a individual to go ahead and have his exclusive responsibility to remarketing of these aircrafts. We donât have that person onboard right now. Right now we are handling it through our â actually through our purchasing department down there. We donât have a aircraft sales department, but as a result of the build up of inventory, we will be focused on that. 
Tyler Hojo - Sidoti & Company
All right great. Thatâs all I had, thatâs a lot gentlemen. 

David Storch
Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Julie Yates, Credit Suisse. Your line is open. 
Krishna Vege - Credit Suisse
Hey guys, this is Krishna Vege filling in for Julie. Just wanted to ask, it seems free cash flow to net income conversion was light this quarter compared to the last couple of 1Qâs. Just was wondering, what are some of the puts and takes on this and how does this compare with where youâd like it to be. Thanks. 
David Storch
So you might note that also we commented that we made investments in our supply chain businesses. So we have net increase of invested capital, even though our return on capital was up 400 basis points. We have a net increase of invested capital there of approximately $25 million. So yes, we are looking invest if you will in the growth of those business. So there is a little pressure short term here on cash, but I think we are investing it wisely. 
Krishna Vege - Credit Suisse
Okay, thank you.
David Storch

The next question is from J.B. Groh of D.A. Davidson. Your line is open. 
J.B. Groh - D.A. Davidson
Yes, hey guys. I just wanted to follow up on Tyler question. I didnât hear you really kind of size that airlift business from the old segmentation to kind of the new segmentation. Can you give us a little help there? 
David Storch
No, weâve never really sized that business precisely. So I donât think its in our public information. So I think the way that weâve been sizing it is really around the number of positions we may change. We may decide to do that differently, but for now at least J.B. we are sizing it by the number of aircrafts. 
J.B. Groh - D.A. Davidson
Okay, thatâs fair enough. And then just a question on, youâve beenâ¦ 
David Storch
And J.B. just to be clear, thatâs for comparative purposes. We know right now and we have a leadership position and we are not looking to educate our competitors. 
J.B. Groh - D.A. Davidson
Yes, completely understand. Just on the new deals that youâve won and the small acquisition, how much of that is in the guidance. I mean in terms of the new deals, when do they start to contribute on the MRO side. 
David Storch
Well, we should start seeing contribution this quarter. 
J.B. Groh - D.A. Davidson
Okay. So thatâs baked into the guidance, the update guidance. 
David Storch
Yes, thatâs correct. 
J.B. Groh - D.A. Davidson
Okay. Thank you. 
David Storch
Thank you. 
Operator
Thank you (Operator Instructions). The next question is from Kevin Ciabattoni, KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Kevin Ciabattoni - KeyBanc Capital Markets 
Thanks. Good afternoon guys. Thanks for taking my question here. 
David Storch
Sure.

Kevin Ciabattoni - KeyBanc Capital Markets 
Just one housekeeping on airlift. I think last quarter you mentioned 28 positions by the end of the year. Just kind of wondering where that stands now. I know you mentioned 23 by the end of 3Q. 
John Fortson
Yes. So hey Kevin, its John. I mean look, there were a number of aircraft positions tied to some contracts that we thought we were going to get awarded and we had a high level of confidence, but over the last 30 to 45 days the situation has deteriorated and we no longer think that those contracts are going to materialize, right. So ultimately what we are loosing, nine slots to that, but then we are picking up an incremental four, right.
Kevin Ciabattoni - KeyBanc Capital Markets 
Okay.
David Storch
Well yes, just to clarify, we did win those contracts, but we just havenât received any task orders. 
John Fortson

Right. 

Kevin Ciabattoni - KeyBanc Capital Markets 
Okay. So I mean assuming that the NATO 18 contract largely, it seems like the power sharing agreements been singed there. Do you guys have any visibility into kind of when you are thinking the security agreement might get signed; maybe kick off some of those task orders. 

David Storch
Yes, unfortunately we do not. You have as much visibility as we do at this point. We tried to gain some of that yesterday in preparation for the release, but we were not successful. So we were hopeful that the love in there would create some opportunities for us, but it hasnât trickled down to us yet. 
Kevin Ciabattoni - KeyBanc Capital Markets 
Okay, thatâs helpful. And then shifting over to kind of the commercial side, could you maybe walk us through the process you went through looking at building the new facility and kind of what we can expect there in terms of CapEx contribution from you guys between now and when thatâ¦?
David Storch
So when we looked at the global market and zeroed in on the U.S. market, we see a need for maintenance hangers that are capable of managing these new generation aircrafts, where the tails are a little bit higher and the wings are a little bit longer and there arenât many facilities in North America capable of handling these aircrafts. 
The State of Illinois was very helpful in allocating funds to build a state of the art that would accommodate these new generation aircrafts and they put together a very attractive package for us and weâll probably start commence building in about six months. It will probably take 18 months from there. So by that stage, some of these aircrafts, the 777X and the 787 will be getting to the point were theyâll be entering the maintenance cycle and we should be in a good position to capture some of that work and the facility will go a long way towards helping. 
Now, in addition to the maintenance facilities that they are building, they are also building a mechanics training facility next door. So we are hopeful that they will be graduating somewhere between a 100 and 150 machines a year that would provide us with a wealth of trained folks to work on these aircrafts. 
Kevin Ciabattoni - KeyBanc Capital Markets 
Yes, I know thatâs been a headwind for you guys in a past, on new talent, so thatâs promising. 
David Storch
I give the State of Illinois credit, not really thought of as a business friendly environment. In this case I think they thought this through very intelligently in terms of kind of combining the training with the facilities with selecting what they consider to be the best MRO provider in the North America and going ahead and pulling the trigger and putting the capital behind this idea. 
Kevin Ciabattoni - KeyBanc Capital Markets 
Okay, thanks. And then just turning to Europe quick, maybe if you have any color you can give us on what type of opportunities you are seeing there via the Brussels operation? It sounds like its going well. Was just kind of curious as to what â maybe if you can give some more specifics. 
David Storch
Yes, so we are touching customers that we havenât touched in the past. So clearly we are in addition to providing them the contracted services that theyâve already agreed to with the predecessor entity, we are seeing opportunities to provide other products and services to these customers. 
So we are fairly optimistic that we can get us a fair share of business from that market, see some growth, take some of the activities deeper into the Middle East where you are seeing growth particularly in new generation aircrafts without the infrastructure lets say, and then the African market, we are looking on that fairly positively as well. So we have a fair level of dialog in all three markets and are relatively encouraged with near term, mid-term and longer term opportunities. 
Kevin Ciabattoni - KeyBanc Capital Markets 
Great, thank you. Iâll jump back in queue. 
David Storch
Okay. Thank you.

Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen and welcome to AAR's Fiscal 2015, Second Quarter Earnings Call.
Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that the comments made during the call may include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. As noted in our news release and the Risk Factors section of the company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2014. In providing forward-looking statements, the company assumes no obligations to provide updates to reflect future circumstances or anticipated or unanticipated events.
At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to AAR's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, David Storch.
David Storch
Well, thank you very much everybody. We start today with a sunny day in Chicago, but no longer. And I want to welcome everybody to our second quarter call. I'm sitting here with a room full of my friends and compatriots, Tim Romenesko and John Fortson are with me and available to answer calls as we get into the call section of this call.
Let me begin by saying that on balance, we had a good quarter far from great, but nevertheless, under all the conditions in which we are operating, we think we had a good quarter. In Aviation Services we had a mixed bag. Within our Aviation Service segment, the supply chain sales were up 15% year-over-year driven largely by strength in our program and aftermarket parts supports business.
Our recently opened Brussels Hub is performing well and allowing us to increase our market presence in Europe, Middle East and Africa. We see continued strong demand for our unique supply chain services from airlines and maintenance providers across the globe.
Our Defense Logistics business is also seeing some positive impacts as a result of increasing flying hours on certain other programs that we support. So for the second half of the year, we expect continued double-digit hopefully as high as 20% year-over-year growth from our Aviation Services supply chain business.
MRO, we experienced year-over-year weakness although sequential improvement and we are entering the second half with strong bookings. So during the period, MRO sales declined 11.5% though as I indicated there was a slight up tick from sequential basis and year-over-year decline is largely due to lower engineering service work, which I believe we discussed in the past.
We are seeing more customer interest in work at our newest MRO facility in Lake Charles both narrow body and wide body. And we expect the balance of fiscal year; we do expect sales growth in the mid to high single digits for our MRO business.
Airlift within our Aviation Service sector continues to transition. We in the second quarter sales are down considerably in the 40% range as we had 17 aircrafts under contract as supposed to 40 back in May of 2014.
For the balance of the year, we expect continued year-over-year sales declines, however, we are working multiple proposals and are expected to hear and hopefully announce positively in the next 30 days or so.
Technology products, we are seeing strength in our Telair cargo group. We had 20% increase in sales on a year-over-year basis driven by growth in commercial products as well as deliveries of the A400M cargo systems. We expect continued strong year-over-year sales growth at Telair cargo group throughout the second half of the year. And the growth rates we expect are should be equal to or greater than the 20% growth we posted in this quarter.

We continue to see reduction in our mobility and machine parts group, 23% reduction in mobility products and additional reduction in our machine parts business as well. But, for the balance for the year, we expect declines at these units, but not at the rates we experienced in the second quarter of this year.
So final thoughts, some of you may have seen Thomson Reuters article, it's not our intension to comment on that article which â I'd be â but at the same token, I have indicated in the past that we are looking at taking action or actioning underperforming units.
In our Technology Product segment, we continued down that path, while at the same time, I believe we are performing the proper function by as we do always performing â growing evaluation of our business units towards the goal of streamlining and focusing our business and also improving our returns on capital.
So with that, I will turn the call over to my team colleague, John Fortson to fill you in on more of the details.
John Fortson
Thanks David. I trust that each of you had a chance to read our earnings release and on this call, I will just review a few key points with regards to our financial performance. Our consolidated gross profit margin this quarter was 16% down from 16.8% in the prior year period, this performance translated into a 16.9% margin for Aviation Services and 13% for Technology Products.
SG&A as a percentage of sales in the first quarter was 9.6% that's slightly higher than 9.5% in the prior year period. However, in the aggregate, our SG&A expenses declined $4 million over the prior year period reflecting continued cost control efforts across the company.
Our operating margin for the quarter was 6.6%. During the second quarter, we generated $16 million in cash from operations and our capital expenditures were $8 million. We paid out $0.075 per shares in dividends this quarter.
Net interest expense for the second quarter declined to $9.5 million from $10.2 million in the prior year. Our net interest expense numbers continued to decline as we focus on paying down debt.
On a year-over-year basis, our net debt is lowered by approximately $40 million. And during this quarter, we retired $30 million of our 1.625% convertible note.
Depreciation and amortization including amortization and stock-based compensation was $19.8 million. For the second quarter, our effective tax rate was 32.7%, per our guidance in July; we expected to remain at this rate throughout the balance of the year. We entered the quarter with 39.1 million shares and the diluted share count. We did repurchase 70,000 shares at an aggregate value of $1.7 million during the quarter.
Thank you for your attention. And I will turn the call to the operator for Q&A.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Larry Solow [CJS Securities].
Larry Solow
Hi, good afternoon. I was wondering if you can comment, David, on the dramatic drop in oil prices. Obviously, helps your commercial customers. Just in terms of the dynamic with some of the newer aircraft that have been coming online, because there's more economic incentive, but now with the oil coming down so much, maybe some of these fuel-efficient â the lack of fuel efficiency in the older aircraft, could they maybe stick around for a little bit longer? And would that directly help your business?
David Storch
First of all, I think it's too early to tell. So the oil prices have dropped precipitously here in the last 90 days or so. So I'm not so certain that we have a trend yet. Clearly, our customers are benefiting from this low oil price rate. But I'm not certain at this point that's caused them to adjust their long-term fleet planning.
Now, that said, our business as you can see â our business supporting the world's fleet is growing quite steadily and at very attractive rates, keeping in mind that all these growth rates are organic. So I believe, we are in a good position expanding our business I think nicely. A suite of products that we offer in supply chain arena in particular are very appealing. And I believe the spread we have now in terms of the capability in North America for airfare maintenance is also quite strong.

So yes, I think that the economic environment is more friendly today than it's been in a while for the airlines. And as that continues whether they take on new aircrafts during that I believe we are well positioned.
Larry Solow
Okay. And then you talked about some of the ramping of the aviation supply, some of those contracts. Can you comment how â I guess the two contracts at Eaton and the one at Unison are those still progressing in a positive direction?
David Storch
Yes. Unison has been placed for a period of time and it's I think fairly steady.
Larry Solow
Okay.
David Storch
And the Eaton programs are in their launch phase and still in a build up phase. We are probably more of a net investor at this point in time than a net beneficiary. But, I would anticipate that as the other distributors work through their inventories, they will be in a good position to start seeing ramp in sales.
Larry Solow
Okay. Then just lastly, you gave some nice itemized guidance over the back half of the year. Putting it all together, and I know sometimes you put annual guidance and don't necessarily look to change it out if you don't have to. But fair to say your full-year outlook is sort of within â where it's similar to what it was last quarter?
David Storch
Yes. I think as we sit here today, we don't see anything different from what we saw at that point when we adjusted earlier in the year.
Larry Solow
Okay, great. I appreciate it. Thanks.
David Storch
Yes. Thank you.
Operator
The next question comes from Tyler Hojo [Sidoti & Company].
Tyler Hojo
Good evening. Just â I totally understand you don't want to comment on the Reuters report. But, David, you did tell us that you would be willing to kind of update us on kind of some potential divestitures, I think, towards the end of the year. And I guess what I'm wondering is, it seems like cargo-loading systems and kind of the Telair acquisition just in general has been one of the better performing assets that you bought. I mean is there any reason to think that that's not kind of a core, in terms of what AIR does going forward?
David Storch
Well, I think everything that we have in our portfolio today is core. So we are reviewing all our businesses this core. I think we are looking at how that we go ahead and maximize our investments. And so I think we are performing normal functions in that regard. And we will continue to do so. So I don't see any change in that regard.
Tyler Hojo
Okay. That's fair. And then just in regards to aero structures and the initiatives there, I know kind of the strategy was to kind of try and improve the operational efficiency of those assets and then kind of try and determine what to do with that business. How have those businesses been performing? Are we back into the profit range now or still kind of where we were?
David Storch
Yes. I don't believe we have seen much change in those businesses. So it's a little bit frustrating from our side. But as I indicated by the end of the year we should be in a position to talk more specifically.
Tyler Hojo
Okay. Got it. And then just as it relates to your prior guidance, I think you are looking for your Airlift business to grow to 23 positions in the third quarter, is that still the expectation?
David Storch
Yes.
Tyler Hojo
Okay. Got it. And how feasibility do you have into that?
David Storch
I think 100%.
Tyler Hojo
Okay. Well, that makes it easy.
David Storch
Yes.
Tyler Hojo
All right, good. And then just one follow-up on the last questioners like of questioning just in regards to oil. What are you seeing â I mean with the drop in oil line, I'm assuming kind of your ability to kind of benefit from the surplus parts market becomes a little bit more challenging. But just what's your view on that?
And then also I guess as it relates to your leasing portfolio, what do you think kind of the implications are for asset values there and does that potentially get you thinking that maybe you look to sell a few more of those assets in the back half of the year?

David Storch
Well, first of all, I view the reduction in oil prices right now as positive. I would be hopeful that the price level will settle â if it settles in the range where we are today, I believe that's very positive for our industry and for ourselves. It's a little bit difficult knowing â it's a little bit difficult to pinpoint where oil prices may fall. But, nevertheless, I believe that the state of the airline industry when oil prices are in the 100 range were very positive. And I think with the price of the barrel being in the 55 to 60 range, it's even that much more positive.
So I look at the industry. I look at the U.S. commercial airline industry as probably being the healthy as it's been since I have been in the industry. And it's helping us think about â think through our strategy as we look at the â how well they are doing and what their prospects look like. So I hope I'm answering your question.
In terms of values on inventory, we are getting â we are able to make good investments. We have made some solid investments this quarter, while we still generate cash from our ops and free cash. So I believe that we have our tentacles out in the worldwide market. And I think we are in a good position to benefit as fleets grow and as fleets change. So yes, I think oil is just â the price of oil I think is contributing to what was already a fairly conducive environment for the things that we do.
Tyler Hojo
Okay. Thanks a lot for that. Appreciate it.
Operator
The next question comes from Kevin Ciabattoni [KeyBanc Capital Markets].
Kevin Ciabattoni
Hi. Good afternoon guys.
David Storch
Hi, Kevin.
Kevin Ciabattoni
Just real quick on airlift, I know â if my numbers are right, you finished last quarter at 19 positions, and it was â if I heard correctly down to 17 at the end of Q2 here. Just wondering if that was an expected drop, I know you said you still expect to get to the 23. I was just curious if that was baked in, because I was under the impression it was going to stay fairly flat?
John Fortson
Hi, Kevin. It's John Fortson. So we did have two aircrafts that were descoped that were not anticipated. So we technically finished the quarter at 17. But, we have actually picked up two aircrafts since quarter end. So we are back to 19.
Kevin Ciabattoni
Okay. I mean â
John Fortson
It's in different geographies. Sorryâ¦
Kevin Ciabattoni
For those in Afghanistan?
John Fortson
No. It's in a different geography.
Kevin Ciabattoni
Okay.
John Fortson
But, yes, I mean we are tracking these obviously very, very carefully. The two that came out were not expected. But, we have actually had two incremental wins. Soâ¦
Kevin Ciabattoni
Okay. Okay. That's helpful. Any update on the aircraft held for sale, I think it was 15 at the end of last quarter. I was just wondering if you guys have made any progress there?
David Storch
Yes. So we are sitting at 16 right now. We have had some progress. We haven't actually sold the aircraft. But, if we think we are getting closer on a couple and we feel like we will get some out of the door by in this quarter.
Kevin Ciabattoni
Okay, perfect. I know it's not a huge piece of the business, but engineering services, I was wondering if you can give us some color on how you think that shakes out in the back half of the year. I mean I guess its one part of the business we didn't really talk about the impact of oil prices here. But, I would imagine carrier profitability improves maybe cabin the refurb environment picks up a little bit and you guys can see some pick up there?
Tim Romenesko
Yes. This is Tim, Kevin. We are working off a few contracts that we have now. But we are taking steps to broaden our customer base in engineering services. We have a couple of programs going on in Asia and a few programs in North America. But, as you know they are very lumpy. And the programs that we have today are smaller than the ones that we are working on a year ago.

So we are investing in some resources now to be â have more exposure to some of the major reconfigurations â interior reconfiguration programs that are going on. We are seeing some opportunity out of our Lake Charles facility where we can do the touch labor. So hopefully by combining our touch labor capability as well as our engineering services capability bolts in North America and in Asia. We are hoping that we are going to able to cash more business there. But, for the balance of the fiscal year, what we see now is roughly inline with what we had in the first half of the fiscal year.
Kevin Ciabattoni
Okay. Thanks Tim. And then last one for me and I will jump back in queue. Any way you guys can quantify the 47-8, how that rate cut there next year, it sounds like would impact your business?
David Storch
Well, it definitely has impact on the â at the cargo system and spares level. But, we do have deliveries in the second half of the fiscal year more so than in the first half of the fiscal year. But, the decline in production will over time obviously have an impact. And then also on some spares. One of the variables though is the split, the mix between passenger and freighter.
Kevin Ciabattoni
Right, right.
David Storch
That it kind of reminds to be seen.
Kevin Ciabattoni
Okay. Thanks.
Operator
[Operator Instructions] The next question comes from Stan Manny [Manny Family Investments].
Stan Manny
Hi, gentlemen. I have a couple of questions. One, David, on cash flow utilization, can we expect the emphasis on debt pay down or stock buyback?
David Storch
Both at the right time, right? In this quarter, we reduced some debt and we bought in some shares. So I think we will continue to look at the best utilization for our cash Stan.
Stan Manny
Okay. And then I have a question that you probably won't answer, but, the equity price is active at normally great in this environment and is there any comments or anything you would be able to say about that?
David Storch
I believe that the shares are undervalued and represent a wonderful investment opportunity.
Stan Manny
Okay. That's the question. Okay. Thank you for good job.
David Storch
Okay. Thank you.

Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that comments made during the call may include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 as noted in our news release and the Risk Factors section of the company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2014.In providing forward-looking statements, the company assumes no obligations to provide updates to reflect future circumstances or anticipated or unanticipated events.At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to AAR's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, David Storch. You may begin.David StorchGood morning. Thank you and thanks to all for joining us here today to discuss our third quarter fiscal 2015 results.As you can tell, a lot has being going on at the company and I'm pleased to announce that we've completed several strategic initiatives for the company and we continue to work on other funds as well.So, we finalized the sale of the Telair Cargo Group. The proceeds we received last week were 705 million. We have 20 million that's in escrow awaiting determination on a particular program and the results from that particular program.Weâve refinanced last week our revolving credit facility. We upped availability to 500 million and we got improved terms. We now essentially have taken anywhere from - let's call it 25 basis points to 75 basis points depending on level and where we are at in terms of cost interest rate reduction on that facility.We commenced this morning the redemption of our $375 million high yield notes. Now we will pay a makehold but the annual interest rate savings by doing this is about $23 million per year.Earlier in the quarter you saw where we announced that our Board has authorized the purchase of $250 million worth of our shares. We also announced the two segments that will be going in the market with. The one segment aviation services will be comprised by our supply chains and MRO businesses and our expeditionary services businesses will be our airlift and mobility businesses.We continue to see growth, solid growth in our aviation service businesses. I believe we have communicated sales increase of just right around 10%, I think it was 9.9% to be precise and over 30% growth in our gross profit margin.The parts business is particularly strong. The MRO business is improving and you may recall within MRO we have our heavy maintenance, we have component maintenance and we have landing gear maintenance.We're seeing good improvement not withstanding competitive pressures, we are seeing good improvement and results coming across that group of businesses.As you can see our airlift business as we've discussed in the past is more or less in transition mode. Last year at this time we had - we started last year's third quarter with 35 flying positions. We ended last yearâs third quarter with 25 flying positions. Today we have 19 flying positions and we expect to be at 21 by the end of the - our fiscal year.And you can see, so weâve had a little bit of rotation, weâve had assets coming out of Afghanistan. We've been successfully in redeploying some of those assets into the DOD down in Africa and we also recently won our first UN contract.Don't get too excited on the UN contract from a profit contribution vantage point as much as may mean in terms of opportunities for the companies. We will be the first U.S. operator operating for them at least in recent history - at least in recent times. So it was a win that we have been working on for quite sometime. It's only one asset at this time but it is directionally I think a good indicator for our company.We are in the process of selling certain assets that we no longer are looking to reposition, we had some assets that we had classified for sales that we actually pulled back into inventory because we think that's a pretty good opportunity placing those particular assets.On the assets we have four sales. We expect to sell five of the â four of the assets in this quarter and hopefully close from a cash standpoint as well.So when you look at the businesses in Q3 in there composite, sales were down 5%, when you consider from an ongoing basis - from a going forward basis. But when you consider the reductions that we've had at the airlift operation in this quarter on a year-over-year basis, I think you can see it was actually a pretty decent quarter for the rest of our businesses.We will attempt to walk you through kind of what businesses would have look like had we not consummated the sales so you can get to some kind of an apples-to-apples comparison.So you can see we reported $0.05. When you take into consideration of the one-timers including adjustments for interest of the onetime adjustments come out to about $0.12. If you look at the airlift quarter on a quarter basis, if you look at the change on year-over-year basis, it's about $0.15.When you look at Telair, it's about $0.15. That would bring you up to about $0.47 and then when you back out the losses from [ANIS] [ph] is about $0.08, it would take you up to around $0.39. So, thatâs our best effort at a reconciliation.We are entering the fourth quarter. I would say and as you look at next - fourth quarter will also add some noise, the noise will be a $200 million gain from the sale of Telair businesses. We will have a charge-off for the backhaul on the high yield notes, which weâve communicated.And there may be certain other things that happened as a result of our efforts to commence in New Year with a nice fresh look at our business. So we feel we're in good position with our businesses, despite in MRO businesses, think of those businesses being aftermarket, independent aftermarket providers.We believe we have - at in least North America very solid leadership position in these markets. We're looking to expand more internationally and looking at various different spots as we've done in the past.Our expeditionary businesses which are really more or less type of supporting U.S. and other friendly government activities outside the United States, those businesses, mobility seems to be relatively stable and airlift as I indicated is going through a series of - is going through a transition out of Afghanistan but there are other fair amount of opportunities that we are looking at.So the building pipeline is strong and we have talked in the past about one particular large program which continues to be out there for the company.On the balance sheet, one more time we feel really good about how the banks view these moves and the feedback they gave us which shows up in terms of improved terms on our revolver I think speaks the volumes to what we are doing and I think in general we feel pretty good about where we stand.So, I think with that let me open up the calls to questions that you may have.Question-and-Answer SessionOperator[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.Robert SpingarnGood morning. Couple of things, with regard to Airlift, and the modest negative margin in the quarter, is this the breakeven level 19 positions? How do we think about that? And I think last quarter you answered a question, you thought you had a 100% visibility into 23 positions this quarter, we are obviously behind that/or below that level and it just seems like this business is either slow to recover or something is tough to see. Could you explain or frame the visibility that you do have?David StorchI think the business has been little slower to recover. Keep in mind now, I believe part of those 23 were also the two that we have coming online later this year with the placement of two aircraft with the British Ministry of Defense against a ten year contract.So, I think it has been a little slower to recover than we had hoped. We have had a series of protest around certain wins that we have had and we have had a couple of programs that had been a little longer to materialize.But again Bob I would say that we feel good about the business. It's unfortunate that we had such a good year last year I guess, and the comparisons will be difficult but we will - you will see improved results coming out of that business.Robert SpingarnSo at this are we at a breakeven low? Are you close to where is 19 the number there, and what's the cash profile here? Is this business cash flow positive at this level?David StorchThe business has historically been extremely cash flow positive. So it's generated fair amount of cash for the company. At current, it's relatively flat from a cash flow standpoint. We will generate cash with the sale of the assets albeit in the $11 million to $12 million range.And we do anticipate that we will - probably this quarter be a net investor but the business should be generating positive cash out into '16.Robert SpingarnOkay, and then just a last thing, could you give us a rough mix within expeditionary. The airlift versus the mobility, just an updated mix?David StorchCall it 50-50. It's a little bit more airlift than it is mobility but approximately let's call it 50-50.Robert SpingarnAnd profit wise and cash flow wise, how do we think about those two pieces?David StorchThere is a lot of different ways to look in these businesses. If we look at them snapshot wise, weâre getting more cash coming out of mobility. If we look it from a - letâs call it a five year horizon, they've both been very strong profit contributors to the company.Airlift at its peak would contribute far more cash than with mobility but mobility at its peak also contributed a fair amount of cash.Robert SpingarnOkay. Thanks David.David StorchThey both by the way should add - they both are leadership positions in their respective markets. The both market I would say are going through - airlift a little bit more of the transition because of the heavy dependence we had on the Afghanistan market but both businesses are leaders in their respective markets.Robert SpingarnRight. Thank you.OperatorAnd our next question comes from the line of Larry Solow from CJS Securities. Your line is now open.Larry SolowGood morning. Just on - touch on airlift again, just in terms of - so you positioned down about 20%, the revenue was down about 45%, or is that the expeditionary services dropped revenue, was that all airlift or was there continue drops in mobility that's a first question?David StorchA little drop in mobility but mostly coming at airlift.Larry SolowAnd is that sort of - the positions were down I guess the ones that remain I guess just less flying hours too so that sort of explain what's down?David StorchIs less flying hours and we had as you recall Larry, we had the S-92s in prior period, and S-92s were huge contributors because it build more for them and they flew more. And the S-92s are now parked looking for a new home.Larry SolowOkay. And what's the outlook for mobility? Is that sort of - you think reaching a trough and flattening?David StorchI would say you'll have periods where it will be a little bit stronger and periods where it will be a little bit weaker. So I think itâs kind of bouncing around. It's still has a nice profitability, still a profitable business. But I would say its giving us a good return on capital but itâs just bouncing around.Larry SolowOkay. And now the Telair deal is closed, I know you had a couple of sort of capital structure initiatives. Any clarity any thought on how you view share purchases and â David StorchIt's definitely in the mix. So itâs really just weâre just trying to get our thoughts together and figure out the best approach.Larry SolowOkay, great. Thanks.OperatorAnd our next question comes from the line of Tyler Hojo with Sidoti & Company. Your line is now open.Tyler HojoHi, thanks for taking the question. Just to go back David your commentary surrounding free cash flow, I guess you talked about being a net investor in terms of cash in Q4. Was that specifically geared for the airlift business or the business overall?David StorchI wouldn't expect the business overall be cash flow positive in Q4.Tyler HojoOkay. Got it.David StorchI think we have certain challenges around airlift as we position assets or every time we win a contract, we have to put some investments - minor investment relatively so, but still investments in the assets and push-off slightly on the assets as well.So I think Q4 for airlift because of the sale of the assets we have pending, I would expect probably from all end probably expect it to be cash flow positive from an operating vantage point it may not be.Tyler HojoOkay, got it. And in regards to kind of the aircraft numbers within airlift, I think you said four are expected to be sold in Q4, how many are up for sale right now?John FortsonThere is 12 available for sale right now. So we last reported to you guys the number was 16, we had talked about potentially taking it up to 18, but we've actually returned some S-61s to the active fleet for use in future mission. So we're sitting at 12 today.Tyler HojoOkay, got it. And then just one last one on airlift I promise. When we talk about kind of going back to Rob's question about where the breakeven is for this business, is there a number or is it really more predicated on the assets you have in Afghanistan and how heavily utilized they are?David StorchI think itâs kind of a mixture of the number of flying positions plus the number of hours they're flying, plus the type of assets that they're. So I think as a point where weâre at right now, weâre kind of at that point that youâre talking about that breakeven point. So, yes, I think it's a mix of all of the above.Tyler HojoOkay. And in regards to kind of the new contracts that you're winning, I mean we talked about UN being kind of not as profitable as some of the legacy sort of contracts. Can you win business that's kind of comparable in profitability profile to kind of some of the legacy stuff is that - David StorchI believe so yes, I believe that you may have - there were some very favorable pricing list, say, at a stage in the Afghanistan buildup, that pricing is probably not available today. But I would say that we have better pricing opportunities that are equal to profit opportunities that we're looking at, yes.Tyler HojoOkay, great. Thanks for that. And just lastly from me, no real kind of commentary from you guys just regards to some of the MRO growth initiatives, so just curious whatâs going on, whatâs the latest and greatest in regards to kind of the wide-body growth initiative?David StorchWeâre still working at hard, I mean we had a tough quarter in late trials, we have lot of build-up cost in late trials during the period notwithstanding those, we still had earnings growth from the businesses.We would expect that we will gain more traction, positive traction I should say this quarter than last. And we feel, we are out there trying to win more wide-body business.Tyler HojoOkay. So gaining traction is just basically winning new customers, is that?David StorchYes. And then performing to our expectation.Tyler HojoGot it, okay. Thanks so much. Appreciate it.OperatorAnd our next question comes from the line of Kevin Ciabattoni with KeyBanc. Your line is now open.Kevin CiabattoniGood morning guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Looking at the margin expansion in the quarter in aviation services, you talked about scope helping out there. David, just wondering if there is anything else you can kind of point to in a little bit more detail regarding the margins there and how you could potentially generate additional margin expansion in that business?David StorchI think for the time being, we are seeing - I think weâre mapping from scale. So our cost structure is based relatively flat and we had slight increase in cost deploying those businesses. We had nice progress in volume improvement, so weâre gaining a little bit of scale thatâs working on our favor.But we also â we are seeing improvement in our landing gear business for instance. So weâre gaining more volume coming through those that shop, our component shops are doing better.So I think across the board youâre seeing improvements in operating. Now we did have aching in Lake Charles, so Lake Charles was a negative contributor during the period which is not unusual this early in the build-up phase of one of our MROs.Kevin CiabattoniSo youâre - just touching on some of the I guess sub businesses of aviation services, it sounds like years coming back kind of as you expected and the trough looks to be in the rear view mirror there?David StorchYes. Itâs slower than we expected and it's not as steep as we had hoped, but it is recovering.Kevin CiabattoniOkay. And then in the press release you talked about using the new capital based kind of growth the existing businesses, what are you guys looking at now in terms of potential growth avenues, whether domestic versus international MRO versus supply chain, any kind of color you can talk about in terms of opportunities for growth?David StorchSo weâre looking at the supply chain business has been exceptionally strong. We are playing around with a few different international activities. You may recall last year weâve acquired the inventory from Sabena Technics, that turned out to be a very good move for the company, very positive move.So weâre looking at other opportunities along those lines, and the pipeline is pretty good.Kevin CiabattoniOkay. And then last one from me and then I'll jump back in queue. Can you talk at all about the kind of pace of the debt redemption and when - I think you mentioned $23 million of annualized savings in terms of kind of timing and the cadence for that what youâre expecting?David StorchSo we put out a - I don't think it's called a tender, but we put down a operative buy to redeem, a redemption I guess is the right word, a redemption on these bonds today and that is a 30 day process.Kevin CiabattoniOkay. Great, thanks.OperatorAnd our next question comes from the line of Stan Manny with Manny Family Investors. Your line is now open.Stan MannyHi all, Stan Manny. David, the use of cash that's coming, do you kind of identified the debt buyback, you identified the stock potential buyback and then there is - youâre generating cash flow continuously while youâre operating. So are there any specific, I know there has been some general questions but are there any specific plans to buy or add assets at all that youâre closed to?David StorchI mean there is the always the possibility right, I mean its kind of the nature of our business is weâre always looking at opportunities. So in terms of close it's hard from me to - your definition of close Stan and mine might be different but we have stopped in the pipeline let me put it that way.Stan MannyOkay. In MRO what seems to be a growing business and your prime asset, the concentrated assets, the area that do not represented very much is international, so can we expect anything in international build-out in MRO?David StorchIt's not for lack of effort. We have to find the right situation. I mean MRO has its kind of subtleties like every business does, but going international is not as easy as it sounds because you're dealing with different cultures and different work habits and things of that nature.Our view is that, yes, we are interested in international MRO. We have gone down numerous paths with different local potential partners, none of which have materialized but we are still out there stirring up the horn nest to try to find the right opportunity.Stan MannyBut you are involved. You are involved in Saudi Arabia, or UAE, on the build-out - you have reasonability for build-out over MRO truly I believe.David StorchYes, that's correct. But that's not â we wonât be operating that facility. We just - they are just buying our expertise on setting up the facility.Stan MannyOkay. But you would not be operating it?David StorchNo. That's the - UAE government will be the operator, we are just - they procured certain capability from us that we are providing them.Stan MannyOkay. So my last question on buyback. Is there a legal career that you can start buying stock to blackout some times you can. Can you define what the career that you could buyback stock or when it starts by SEC rules or whatever?David StorchWell, there are rules and there are laws and we abide by every one of them. So it depends on the structure and we are right now in the blackout because we tend to allow investors 24-hours or so to absorb the information. So yes, we will abide by every law there is.Stan MannyOkay. But the period â what I'm trying to get understand is, when does it open up possibility so you can legally start buying?David StorchI think tomorrow.Stan MannyOkay. Well good luck. Thank you very much.OperatorThank you. And I'm showing no further question at this time.David StorchOkay. Thanks everyone for participating. And have a nice day.OperatorLadies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in todayâs conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect.

Good morning ladies and gentlemen and welcome to AAR's Fiscal 2015 Third Quarter Earnings Call. Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that comments made during the call may include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 as noted in our news release and the Risk Factors section of the company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2014.
In providing forward-looking statements, the company assumes no obligations to provide updates to reflect future circumstances or anticipated or unanticipated events.
At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to AAR's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, David Storch. You may begin.
David Storch
Good morning. Thank you and thanks to all for joining us here today to discuss our third quarter fiscal 2015 results.
As you can tell, a lot has being going on at the company and I'm pleased to announce that we've completed several strategic initiatives for the company and we continue to work on other funds as well.
So, we finalized the sale of the Telair Cargo Group. The proceeds we received last week were 705 million. We have 20 million that's in escrow awaiting determination on a particular program and the results from that particular program.
Weâve refinanced last week our revolving credit facility. We upped availability to 500 million and we got improved terms. We now essentially have taken anywhere from - let's call it 25 basis points to 75 basis points depending on level and where we are at in terms of cost interest rate reduction on that facility.
We commenced this morning the redemption of our $375 million high yield notes. Now we will pay a makehold but the annual interest rate savings by doing this is about $23 million per year.
Earlier in the quarter you saw where we announced that our Board has authorized the purchase of $250 million worth of our shares. We also announced the two segments that will be going in the market with. The one segment aviation services will be comprised by our supply chains and MRO businesses and our expeditionary services businesses will be our airlift and mobility businesses.
We continue to see growth, solid growth in our aviation service businesses. I believe we have communicated sales increase of just right around 10%, I think it was 9.9% to be precise and over 30% growth in our gross profit margin.
The parts business is particularly strong. The MRO business is improving and you may recall within MRO we have our heavy maintenance, we have component maintenance and we have landing gear maintenance.
We're seeing good improvement not withstanding competitive pressures, we are seeing good improvement and results coming across that group of businesses.
As you can see our airlift business as we've discussed in the past is more or less in transition mode. Last year at this time we had - we started last year's third quarter with 35 flying positions. We ended last yearâs third quarter with 25 flying positions. Today we have 19 flying positions and we expect to be at 21 by the end of the - our fiscal year.
And you can see, so weâve had a little bit of rotation, weâve had assets coming out of Afghanistan. We've been successfully in redeploying some of those assets into the DOD down in Africa and we also recently won our first UN contract.
Don't get too excited on the UN contract from a profit contribution vantage point as much as may mean in terms of opportunities for the companies. We will be the first U.S. operator operating for them at least in recent history - at least in recent times. So it was a win that we have been working on for quite sometime. It's only one asset at this time but it is directionally I think a good indicator for our company.

We are in the process of selling certain assets that we no longer are looking to reposition, we had some assets that we had classified for sales that we actually pulled back into inventory because we think that's a pretty good opportunity placing those particular assets.
On the assets we have four sales. We expect to sell five of the â four of the assets in this quarter and hopefully close from a cash standpoint as well.
So when you look at the businesses in Q3 in there composite, sales were down 5%, when you consider from an ongoing basis - from a going forward basis. But when you consider the reductions that we've had at the airlift operation in this quarter on a year-over-year basis, I think you can see it was actually a pretty decent quarter for the rest of our businesses.
We will attempt to walk you through kind of what businesses would have look like had we not consummated the sales so you can get to some kind of an apples-to-apples comparison.
So you can see we reported $0.05. When you take into consideration of the one-timers including adjustments for interest of the onetime adjustments come out to about $0.12. If you look at the airlift quarter on a quarter basis, if you look at the change on year-over-year basis, it's about $0.15.
When you look at Telair, it's about $0.15. That would bring you up to about $0.47 and then when you back out the losses from [ANIS] [ph] is about $0.08, it would take you up to around $0.39. So, thatâs our best effort at a reconciliation.
We are entering the fourth quarter. I would say and as you look at next - fourth quarter will also add some noise, the noise will be a $200 million gain from the sale of Telair businesses. We will have a charge-off for the backhaul on the high yield notes, which weâve communicated.
And there may be certain other things that happened as a result of our efforts to commence in New Year with a nice fresh look at our business. So we feel we're in good position with our businesses, despite in MRO businesses, think of those businesses being aftermarket, independent aftermarket providers.
We believe we have - at in least North America very solid leadership position in these markets. We're looking to expand more internationally and looking at various different spots as we've done in the past.
Our expeditionary businesses which are really more or less type of supporting U.S. and other friendly government activities outside the United States, those businesses, mobility seems to be relatively stable and airlift as I indicated is going through a series of - is going through a transition out of Afghanistan but there are other fair amount of opportunities that we are looking at.
So the building pipeline is strong and we have talked in the past about one particular large program which continues to be out there for the company.
On the balance sheet, one more time we feel really good about how the banks view these moves and the feedback they gave us which shows up in terms of improved terms on our revolver I think speaks the volumes to what we are doing and I think in general we feel pretty good about where we stand.
So, I think with that let me open up the calls to questions that you may have.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
Robert Spingarn
Good morning. Couple of things, with regard to Airlift, and the modest negative margin in the quarter, is this the breakeven level 19 positions? How do we think about that? And I think last quarter you answered a question, you thought you had a 100% visibility into 23 positions this quarter, we are obviously behind that/or below that level and it just seems like this business is either slow to recover or something is tough to see. Could you explain or frame the visibility that you do have?

David Storch
I think the business has been little slower to recover. Keep in mind now, I believe part of those 23 were also the two that we have coming online later this year with the placement of two aircraft with the British Ministry of Defense against a ten year contract.
So, I think it has been a little slower to recover than we had hoped. We have had a series of protest around certain wins that we have had and we have had a couple of programs that had been a little longer to materialize.
But again Bob I would say that we feel good about the business. It's unfortunate that we had such a good year last year I guess, and the comparisons will be difficult but we will - you will see improved results coming out of that business.
Robert Spingarn
So at this are we at a breakeven low? Are you close to where is 19 the number there, and what's the cash profile here? Is this business cash flow positive at this level?
David Storch
The business has historically been extremely cash flow positive. So it's generated fair amount of cash for the company. At current, it's relatively flat from a cash flow standpoint. We will generate cash with the sale of the assets albeit in the $11 million to $12 million range.
And we do anticipate that we will - probably this quarter be a net investor but the business should be generating positive cash out into '16.
Robert Spingarn
Okay, and then just a last thing, could you give us a rough mix within expeditionary. The airlift versus the mobility, just an updated mix?
David Storch
Call it 50-50. It's a little bit more airlift than it is mobility but approximately let's call it 50-50.
Robert Spingarn
And profit wise and cash flow wise, how do we think about those two pieces?
David Storch
There is a lot of different ways to look in these businesses. If we look at them snapshot wise, weâre getting more cash coming out of mobility. If we look it from a - letâs call it a five year horizon, they've both been very strong profit contributors to the company.
Airlift at its peak would contribute far more cash than with mobility but mobility at its peak also contributed a fair amount of cash.
Robert Spingarn
Okay. Thanks David.
David Storch
They both by the way should add - they both are leadership positions in their respective markets. The both market I would say are going through - airlift a little bit more of the transition because of the heavy dependence we had on the Afghanistan market but both businesses are leaders in their respective markets.
Robert Spingarn
Right. Thank you.
Operator
And our next question comes from the line of Larry Solow from CJS Securities. Your line is now open.
Larry Solow
Good morning. Just on - touch on airlift again, just in terms of - so you positioned down about 20%, the revenue was down about 45%, or is that the expeditionary services dropped revenue, was that all airlift or was there continue drops in mobility that's a first question?
David Storch
A little drop in mobility but mostly coming at airlift.
Larry Solow
And is that sort of - the positions were down I guess the ones that remain I guess just less flying hours too so that sort of explain what's down?
David Storch
Is less flying hours and we had as you recall Larry, we had the S-92s in prior period, and S-92s were huge contributors because it build more for them and they flew more. And the S-92s are now parked looking for a new home.
Larry Solow
Okay. And what's the outlook for mobility? Is that sort of - you think reaching a trough and flattening?
David Storch
I would say you'll have periods where it will be a little bit stronger and periods where it will be a little bit weaker. So I think itâs kind of bouncing around. It's still has a nice profitability, still a profitable business. But I would say its giving us a good return on capital but itâs just bouncing around.

Larry Solow
Okay. And now the Telair deal is closed, I know you had a couple of sort of capital structure initiatives. Any clarity any thought on how you view share purchases and â 
David Storch
It's definitely in the mix. So itâs really just weâre just trying to get our thoughts together and figure out the best approach.
Larry Solow
Okay, great. Thanks.
Operator
And our next question comes from the line of Tyler Hojo with Sidoti & Company. Your line is now open.
Tyler Hojo
Hi, thanks for taking the question. Just to go back David your commentary surrounding free cash flow, I guess you talked about being a net investor in terms of cash in Q4. Was that specifically geared for the airlift business or the business overall?
David Storch
I wouldn't expect the business overall be cash flow positive in Q4.
Tyler Hojo
Okay. Got it.
David Storch
I think we have certain challenges around airlift as we position assets or every time we win a contract, we have to put some investments - minor investment relatively so, but still investments in the assets and push-off slightly on the assets as well.
So I think Q4 for airlift because of the sale of the assets we have pending, I would expect probably from all end probably expect it to be cash flow positive from an operating vantage point it may not be.
Tyler Hojo
Okay, got it. And in regards to kind of the aircraft numbers within airlift, I think you said four are expected to be sold in Q4, how many are up for sale right now?
John Fortson
There is 12 available for sale right now. So we last reported to you guys the number was 16, we had talked about potentially taking it up to 18, but we've actually returned some S-61s to the active fleet for use in future mission. So we're sitting at 12 today.
Tyler Hojo
Okay, got it. And then just one last one on airlift I promise. When we talk about kind of going back to Rob's question about where the breakeven is for this business, is there a number or is it really more predicated on the assets you have in Afghanistan and how heavily utilized they are?
David Storch
I think itâs kind of a mixture of the number of flying positions plus the number of hours they're flying, plus the type of assets that they're. So I think as a point where weâre at right now, weâre kind of at that point that youâre talking about that breakeven point. So, yes, I think it's a mix of all of the above.
Tyler Hojo
Okay. And in regards to kind of the new contracts that you're winning, I mean we talked about UN being kind of not as profitable as some of the legacy sort of contracts. Can you win business that's kind of comparable in profitability profile to kind of some of the legacy stuff is that - 
David Storch
I believe so yes, I believe that you may have - there were some very favorable pricing list, say, at a stage in the Afghanistan buildup, that pricing is probably not available today. But I would say that we have better pricing opportunities that are equal to profit opportunities that we're looking at, yes.
Tyler Hojo
Okay, great. Thanks for that. And just lastly from me, no real kind of commentary from you guys just regards to some of the MRO growth initiatives, so just curious whatâs going on, whatâs the latest and greatest in regards to kind of the wide-body growth initiative?
David Storch
Weâre still working at hard, I mean we had a tough quarter in late trials, we have lot of build-up cost in late trials during the period notwithstanding those, we still had earnings growth from the businesses.
We would expect that we will gain more traction, positive traction I should say this quarter than last. And we feel, we are out there trying to win more wide-body business.
Tyler Hojo
Okay. So gaining traction is just basically winning new customers, is that?
David Storch
Yes. And then performing to our expectation.

Tyler Hojo
Got it, okay. Thanks so much. Appreciate it.
Operator
And our next question comes from the line of Kevin Ciabattoni with KeyBanc. Your line is now open.
Kevin Ciabattoni
Good morning guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Looking at the margin expansion in the quarter in aviation services, you talked about scope helping out there. David, just wondering if there is anything else you can kind of point to in a little bit more detail regarding the margins there and how you could potentially generate additional margin expansion in that business?
David Storch
I think for the time being, we are seeing - I think weâre mapping from scale. So our cost structure is based relatively flat and we had slight increase in cost deploying those businesses. We had nice progress in volume improvement, so weâre gaining a little bit of scale thatâs working on our favor.
But we also â we are seeing improvement in our landing gear business for instance. So weâre gaining more volume coming through those that shop, our component shops are doing better.
So I think across the board youâre seeing improvements in operating. Now we did have aching in Lake Charles, so Lake Charles was a negative contributor during the period which is not unusual this early in the build-up phase of one of our MROs.
Kevin Ciabattoni
So youâre - just touching on some of the I guess sub businesses of aviation services, it sounds like years coming back kind of as you expected and the trough looks to be in the rear view mirror there?
David Storch
Yes. Itâs slower than we expected and it's not as steep as we had hoped, but it is recovering.
Kevin Ciabattoni
Okay. And then in the press release you talked about using the new capital based kind of growth the existing businesses, what are you guys looking at now in terms of potential growth avenues, whether domestic versus international MRO versus supply chain, any kind of color you can talk about in terms of opportunities for growth?
David Storch
So weâre looking at the supply chain business has been exceptionally strong. We are playing around with a few different international activities. You may recall last year weâve acquired the inventory from Sabena Technics, that turned out to be a very good move for the company, very positive move.
So weâre looking at other opportunities along those lines, and the pipeline is pretty good.
Kevin Ciabattoni
Okay. And then last one from me and then I'll jump back in queue. Can you talk at all about the kind of pace of the debt redemption and when - I think you mentioned $23 million of annualized savings in terms of kind of timing and the cadence for that what youâre expecting?
David Storch
So we put out a - I don't think it's called a tender, but we put down a operative buy to redeem, a redemption I guess is the right word, a redemption on these bonds today and that is a 30 day process.
Kevin Ciabattoni
Okay. Great, thanks.
Operator
And our next question comes from the line of Stan Manny with Manny Family Investors. Your line is now open.
Stan Manny
Hi all, Stan Manny. David, the use of cash that's coming, do you kind of identified the debt buyback, you identified the stock potential buyback and then there is - youâre generating cash flow continuously while youâre operating. So are there any specific, I know there has been some general questions but are there any specific plans to buy or add assets at all that youâre closed to?
David Storch
I mean there is the always the possibility right, I mean its kind of the nature of our business is weâre always looking at opportunities. So in terms of close it's hard from me to - your definition of close Stan and mine might be different but we have stopped in the pipeline let me put it that way.
Stan Manny
Okay. In MRO what seems to be a growing business and your prime asset, the concentrated assets, the area that do not represented very much is international, so can we expect anything in international build-out in MRO?

David Storch
It's not for lack of effort. We have to find the right situation. I mean MRO has its kind of subtleties like every business does, but going international is not as easy as it sounds because you're dealing with different cultures and different work habits and things of that nature.
Our view is that, yes, we are interested in international MRO. We have gone down numerous paths with different local potential partners, none of which have materialized but we are still out there stirring up the horn nest to try to find the right opportunity.
Stan Manny
But you are involved. You are involved in Saudi Arabia, or UAE, on the build-out - you have reasonability for build-out over MRO truly I believe.
David Storch
Yes, that's correct. But that's not â we wonât be operating that facility. We just - they are just buying our expertise on setting up the facility.
Stan Manny
Okay. But you would not be operating it?
David Storch
No. That's the - UAE government will be the operator, we are just - they procured certain capability from us that we are providing them.
Stan Manny
Okay. So my last question on buyback. Is there a legal career that you can start buying stock to blackout some times you can. Can you define what the career that you could buyback stock or when it starts by SEC rules or whatever?
David Storch
Well, there are rules and there are laws and we abide by every one of them. So it depends on the structure and we are right now in the blackout because we tend to allow investors 24-hours or so to absorb the information. So yes, we will abide by every law there is.
Stan Manny
Okay. But the period â what I'm trying to get understand is, when does it open up possibility so you can legally start buying?
David Storch
I think tomorrow.
Stan Manny
Okay. Well good luck. Thank you very much.
Operator
Thank you. And I'm showing no further question at this time.
David Storch
Okay. Thanks everyone for participating. And have a nice day.

Good morning ladies and gentlemen and welcome to AAR's Fiscal 2015 Fourth Quarter and Year-End Earnings Call. Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that comments made during the call may include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 as noted in our news release and the Risk Factors section of the company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2014.
In providing forward-looking statements, the company assumes no obligations to provide updates to reflect future circumstances or anticipated or unanticipated events.
At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to AAR's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, David Storch.
David Storch
Good morning and thank you for participating today. As you know, yesterday last evening we put out our fourth quarter and year-end release. What I'd like to do is just spend some time going through where we are at and where we are heading, and I'll then turn it over to John who will fill in some of the financial data.
So as we indicated at last year's annual planning session, we felt that we'd be better served, our shareholders will be better served if we narrowed our focus and zeroed in on our industry-leading services business as an area for growth and opportunity. So, we set out during the year and determined that we would sell our large manufacturing businesses, and like I said focus on our industry leading service activity, and we really think about the activity in four phases.
Phase 1, which we indicate was the sale of Telair Cargo Group which was completed at the end of March, and then the classification of our precision machining businesses as discontinued operations. Upon completing this, we do still maintain our mobility business, which as you know is an industry leading business currently still off the point at the cycle, but a business nevertheless that has served the company well over a long period of time and a very strong management team, very strong position, and unique business, and we feel at this point in time that we'd like to figure out still how to maximize that business and our investment in that business.
Phase 2, we paid down our high yield bonds, and we returned a significant amount of money, capital I should say to shareholders. So, we paid down our $325 million of roughly 7% interest rated bonds. By paying that down, we will save about $23 million to $24 million a year in interest expense. And then, we also as you know, through the tender offer purchased back 4.2 million shares. We've purchased another 0.5 million shares in the open market. So we've returned about $152 [ph] million in cash to shareholders here through share repurchase and dividends.
Phase 3, we've really been looking through the balance of our portfolio to identify and exit underperforming activities. So again, we could zero in on and focus on those areas where we feel we have the most potential and biggest opportunities. So you see that we sold off the remaining of our owned aircraft from our aircraft leasing portfolio which we really started disinvesting back in 2007, this is more or less the tail and we saw an opportunity here to generate some cash and get our aircraft sales and leasing folks focused on other activity and more profitable ventures.
And then lastly, Phase 4, which we're currently in, we expect to grow our businesses by taking advantage of our very strong balance sheet. In the fourth quarter, you will see that the Aviation Service segment sales grew 17%. That's organic growth largely driven by the growth in our supply chain businesses as well as improvements in our MRO. We also as you know, announced in Q1 of this fiscal year that we have closed down our Hot Springs operations. We are moving that work over to Oklahoma City. Our goal there is to just figure out how to maximize our footprint and drive more margin through our service businesses.

Now the Expeditionary Service segment saw a sales decline of 51% on a year-over-year basis largely driven by lower -- fewer flying positions in airlift, but also lower revenues at mobility just reflecting reduced demand from the DoD for those types of products. But we do anticipate that this is at a bottom point for that business and we are hopeful that things will turn in our favor, more in our favor in that business as this year kind of progresses.
The Airlift business did incur losses during the period as we continued to transition assets from Afghanistan into other theatres. We have incurred program startup costs and costs associated with repositioning some of the assets. But we also, on the positive we've been awarded over $500 million in new contract awards, and as you know we have a very robust deal pipeline. Some of the businesses have not happened as timely as we'd like to see, but it still is out there and we still believe we are in pretty good shape to capture more business in the airlift operation.
The balance sheet, on capital structure, so we've reduced our net debt by $446 million on a year-on-year basis, so our net debt-to-capital ratio at the end of May is 10.5% and that's down from about 35% at that point in time prior year. So we are sitting today with close to $450 million of cash in availability, and we feel pretty good about our powder and our ability to go ahead and grow our remaining businesses based on having this stronger balance sheet.
We also, as I indicated, bought in some shares. Our share count is down from 39.2 [ph] at the end of the last year to 34.9 [ph] at the end of the latest fiscal year. So we think we have good leverage and really good possibilities and a really good opportunity pool out there that we're looking for.
So when I think about where we're heading, which I think is a critical question for you all would be, I want to take our industry-leading supply chain business and MRO businesses where we have performed exceptionally well and grow these businesses. I'd like to grow them geographically.
So I'd like to have more content outside the United States, and this is a drive we've been on for the last few years and you may recall last year we were successful in buying out the Sabena supply chain business, Sabena Technics supply chain business, and we're looking at other opportunities along those lines, and having this stronger balance sheet, we feel really good about our ability to go ahead and growth that business.
We're also looking at other MRO opportunities. We did announce an MOU with South Africa technical operations to explore doing work in that market. Once upon a time, that was one of the industry-leading MRO facilities, more or less deteriorated over the last few couple of decades and they have a motivation to improve their position, and they sought out AAR as a partner to help them achieve that. So we think we can potentially look at that low cost environment for us to grow more of our -- grow our MRO business outside the United States.
The airlift business as I indicated, we have as a result of draw down in Afghanistan we have taken our fleet count from nine different fleet types we will down for five fleet types there once we start operating the AW189s over in the Falklands. So we are looking to grow that business through the, do more of what we're currently doing in Africa. We have placed a couple of aircraft into Iraq.
We still do have positions in Afghanistan. We expect those to continue and then we're looking to see if there are some opportunities in the Gulf Coast market which the government provided the equipment that we'll operate on behalf of the government as well as more niche markets that we think are out there for us. And again we have I think an excellent leadership team at the helm of that business and they will win their fair share of business going forward.

So in summary, from my vantage point this has been a very momentous year. I think it has been a great year for the Company. If you look at, if I may just for a second, if you look at how we built this Company we looked at the market terrain post 9/11 let's say and we've viewed the need to go ahead and diversify our product mix. Largely coming into 9/11 we were very heavily dependent on the U.S. domestic commercial airline industry. We now believe that that industry is in pretty good of healthy position and the need for us to be as diversified and have as many activities going on was not as prevalent as they had been, say 15 years ago.
So, when I look at the portfolio today, I feel very positive about the mix of businesses. I feel exceptionally positive about our balance sheet and our financial flexibility and when I look out into the future I get very excited about what's in front of us as a company. When I think about the year that we're about to go into, clearly the fourth quarter was a lot of moving parts and as I indicated strength in our supply chain and MRO businesses weaknesses in our Expeditionary services.
I believe as we enter the new fiscal year we should continue to see the strength in the aviation service side and we should start seeing improvements in our Expeditionary services activity. And as the year progresses as particularly as we start operations in the Falklands that business returns to profitability, decent profits I should say before the year is out.
So, I'm going to turn the call over to John and I'll let John describe some of the financial items. Thanks John.
John Fortson
Thanks David. I trust that you guys have had a chance to read our earnings release. It was a very busy year for AAR and I'll try and put some color around the events that occurred in the fourth quarter and the effects they had both on the quarter and on the full year.
Let me start by saying sales for the quarter of $450.8 million were 1.1% less than prior year sales. As David mentioned we had strong results in Aviation Services, but they were not sufficient to offset the decline of our Expeditionary Services segment, which as you guys are aware is heavily leveraged to the defense markets.
On the profitability side our results were impacted by the unusual charges a result of us refocusing our platform to product lines that we consider core to our services offering going forward. During the fourth quarter we recorded the following operational charges from our continuing operations. $69.5 million in impairment charges and other losses are related to certain product lines identified as underperforming and are not a part of the Company's strategy going forward.
The majority $61.4 million of these actions relate to our Aviation Services segment and include $17.9 million for sold aircraft in the aircraft lease portfolio, $43.6 million in inventory and supply chain in MRO businesses that are in excess to ARR's need or where we're exiting certain lines and $8.2 million for certain aircraft and inventory that are in the Expeditionary Services segment.
Besides those, we also took charges related to our recapitalization of our corporate restructuring and they also are in the continuing operations for the fourth quarter. $44.9 million loss recognized in the extinguishment of our high yield debt, $4.5 million in charges related to the corporate office restructuring including writing down certain corporate assets and severance which are recorded in the SG&A line and then $2 million in charges for an early termination of a swap and cap arrangement that's recorded in our interest expense line.
As a result of the above actions and in combination with the reduced share count which we anticipate to be $34.9 million for the start of this coming fiscal year, we expect to achieve significantly better operating income to net income conversion.

Also during the fourth quarter we recorded the following charges from discontinued operations. We had a pre-tax gain net of transaction expenses in fees of $198.6 million from the sale of the Telair Cargo Group. The gain excludes $35 million of contingent consideration which could be realized prior to December 31, 2015. We also had an additional $11.1 million impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of Precision Systems businesses. The total impact for that for the course of the year is $57.5 million. Fiscal year 2015 adjusted financials for the unusual items will result in $0.87 per share on a continuing basis or $2.51 on a consolidated basis.
SG&A as a percentage of sales in the fourth quarter was 12.3%. This is higher than the last few quarters and it is due to some extent to the lower sales volume, but also due to the effects of some of the charges that I have outlined. The same is true for the operating margins also negative due to the charges that we took.
During the fourth quarter the Company used $52 million in cash flow from operations. This was negatively impacted by the Telair Cargo Group sale tax requirements and was also reduced by some of the cash generation in our Expeditionary Services segment. We had capital expenditures Q4 of $22.6 million. The company paid dividends totaling $3 million. For the year-over-year it was $43 million of cash from operations and our total capital expenditures were $46.3 million.
We de-levered significantly and we reduced our net indebtedness as David mentioned by $446 million, ending the year with net debt of $99 million, our net debt-to-EBITDA is less than 1.0 down from 2.3 times last year.
Net interest expense for the fourth quarter increased to $7.1 million, but this included as I mentioned before the $2 million associated with the one-time settlement of the cap and swap, our net interest expense numbers will be significantly lower next year as a result of our large debt pay down. Depreciation and amortization including amortization of stock based compensation was $76.9 million for the year.
In the fourth quarter, we entered a sale and leaseback transaction for two aircrafts supporting our new contract in the Falklands. In addition, in June we sold one Bell 214 aircraft bringing our total aircrafts held for sale to eight. The current book value of assets held for sale is approximately $14 million. As weâve alluded to in some of our previous conversations, our effective tax rate for 2015 was 34.4%.
Thanks for your attention and Iâll turn the call back over to David for some closing comments.
David Storch
Thanks John. Let me just say the operational charges that John referred to were taken and the primary motivation there is get our team and organization focused around higher performing opportunities, higher margin opportunities. So we exited certain product lines in our landing gear repair business, we exited certain product lines in our trading activities, all geared again getting people really focused on higher margin opportunities and thatâs the theme [ph] you will be hearing from us throughout the year. In any event, let me now turn it back to the moderator to open up for any questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Robert Spingarn
Good morning David and John.
David Storch
Good morning.
Robert Spingarn
David at a high level, is there a reason you havenât given us a more specific guidance for 2016?
David Storch
Yes Rob, what we would like to do is, we would like to let the year kick in, let's start the year. We have a fair amount of variability in our airlift business, and as Iâve indicated, we've won some contracts and we do have some contracts we believe weâre going to win. So there is a little bit of far enough range at this stage that I think we prefer not to put out the numbers at this point.

Robert Spingarn
Can I ask you then just a couple of more specific questions, at least it may give us some help in that area, one would be the $500 million in new contracts for airlift, what period of time do those cover?
David Storch
Well, the largest contract is the Falklands contract which is $339 million, and thatâs over a 12-year period.
Robert Spingarn
Okay.
David Storch
And then the balance of the contracts are three years and one contract is a five-year.
Robert Spingarn
Okay. And then in terms of the fleet, are you down to how many aircraft are you down to now, I think you said 21 are in contract service?
John Fortson
Hi Rob, itâs John, yes so when we talk, we talk in terms of contract and revenue generating positions. We finished the year with 19 positions. Sitting here today, we are at 21.
Robert Spingarn
Do you have a rough idea where you expect to close out the year -- if or range perhaps that maybe reflectsâ¦?
John Fortson
Yes and so, we based on current deal flow, based on current contracts, weâre looking at 32 at the end of the year.
Robert Spingarn
Okay. Okay. And then how do we think about margins going forward in the two businesses? Do you think as volumes improve in aviation we can get some margin lift there? Youâve done the consolidation, I assume that starts to help at some point, are you doing that in August? And then how do we think about the profitability or the incremental profitability of the new work in Expeditionary? Thanks.
David Storch
Yes, so we have historically had very strong margins in the Expeditionary segment thatâs going to be volume based, so as the volume picks up, weâll start seeing margin throughput from that business. So, right now in both businesses, in Expeditionary, youâre at the kind of at the bottom point of the historical results cycle, if you will.
In terms of the MRO in supply chain, I would anticipate that weâll see better margins throughout the year. So the supply chain margins will improve as volumes grow as well as the MRO. Then the MRO, the move out of Hot Springs saves us about $1.5 million a year or adds $1.5 million a year to the margin, the gross margin for that section of our business.
Robert Spingarn
Okay, thank you.
David Storch
Yep.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Ciabattoni with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Kevin Ciabattoni
Hi, good morning David and John. Thanks for taking my questions here.
David Storch
Good morning. Sure.
Kevin Ciabattoni
Just to followup on Robâs last question, any disruption that we would see over the next quarter to as Hot Springs shuts down or I guess any other one-time charges that might be kind of residual over the next quarter or two?
David Storch
You know what, the one-time charge from that is what about $1 million from the shutdown of Hot Springs. I believe that for the most part, I canât think of any other charges that we see coming at us. We will be selling some airlift aircraft. The net effect though of the sale of the aircraft is about I would say somewhere between $18 million and $22 million of sales will probably be neutral, we wouldnât expect losses, if anything we might have slight gains from those sales.
So we donât expect any other noise other than John referred to the tale to the Darwin, Iâm sorry for the Telair transaction of up to $35 million pattern that would be a positive impact.
Kevin Ciabattoni
Okay, thatâs helpful.
David Storch
That 18 to 22 Kevin includes inventory thatâs associated with some of those aircraft down there.
Kevin Ciabattoni
Right, okay got it. Yep. And then just touching on Airlift, so you added two positions to go from 19 to 21 post the close of the quarter here. Can you just help us, I mean should we expect to see a sequential growth in Airlift revenues as we go into Q1 because of that, or are those not active yet, so the revenue is not going to flow through? I know obviously it will have some impact, negative impact on the gross margin line for startup costs that you mentioned, just trying to get a handle on what to expect in terms of the revenue from those two positions?

Timothy Romenesko
Yes, so Kevin this is Tim Romenesko. So, yeah and so, we really see the revenue ramp later in the fiscal year when the larger programs kick in. In the early part of the fiscal year, we will be incurring costs associated with the startup of the Falklands program, and that includes taking on the new aircraft and includes the pilot training, building up the maintenance capability. So those costs are fairly significant and will kind of mute some of the positive impact of the new aircraft that weâre bringing on board.
But once we get into, once we get the Falklandâs contract ramping and we get the cumulative effect of the other aircraft coming on, that business will be generating decent returns and will be kind of back to not exactly where it was before, but approaching its peak performance.
Kevin Ciabattoni
Okay, thanks Tim. And then the last one from me and Iâll jump back in queue here. If you could just give an update on kind of what youâre seeing at Lake Charles in terms of capacity and business development there? And then maybe a quick update on progress at Rockford?
John Holmes
Sure. This is John Holmes. I am responsible for the Aviation Services Group. At Lake Charles, weâre still on a hiring phase there. We went through quite a ramp up period in FY 2015. We expect to get to at least a breakeven operation there in FY 2016. Weâve got some significant programs starting with Delta Airlines that will be ramping up in the fall and so weâre looking forward to the positive impact there out of Lake Charles.
And Hot Springs, the consolidation actually will be done by the end of this month and weâll have exited, so the main customer that was in Rockford was Air Wisconsin there transitioning to Oklahoma City and then by the end of August weâll have exited the operations in Hot Springs.
Kevin Ciabattoni
Okay, thanks.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of J.B. Groh with D.A. Davidson. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
J.B. Groh
Hey thanks guys. Thanks for taking my question. Hey could you talk about this organic growth in supply chain and MRO, could you maybe break that out between the two businesses just generally?
David Storch
Can you repeat that, can you just repeat that please and we werenât able to hear you.
J.B. Groh
Oh, Iâm sorry, the organic growth in the Aviation Services business, can you break that out between kind of what you saw in supply chain versus MRO is one of those stronger than the other and is there new programs at supply chain thatâs driving that growth or is it just pure organic growth?
David Storch
Yes, well so we donât comment on the individual necessarily, but suffice to say the growth in supply chain was strong, was very strong.
J.B. Groh
So was there new programs that were driving that or was it justâ¦?
David Storch
Yes new programs and you may recall, I would say about a year ago we entered into an agreement with Eaton and we've started taking delivery of the inventory for Eaton and we've started making sales from the - in supporting the Eaton products during this period. And program activity was strong and across the board we had strength in the supply chain businesses, as we did in the MRO business.
J.B. Groh
Okay.
David Storch
A 17% organic growth in this period if you check around the horns, there are very few companies growing at that rate in our industry.
J.B. Groh
Agreed, agreed, yes. John, can you maybe give us now that we've got some charges to sort of a run rate on SG&A, what is the expectation there?
John Fortson
Yes, I mean look, I think our SG&A is going to revert into the sort of 9% to 10% range where it should do a little bit better than we have historically, but I think for modelling I would sort of assume that.
J.B. Groh
Okay. Thatâs all I have. Thank you.

Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Stan Mann with Mann Family Investments. Your line is open.
Stan Mann
Thank you. Good job gentlemen. I have a couple of questions, David. One use of cash, do you see the cash being used for acquisitions, more stock buyback, have you got a feel or outlook for that?
David Storch
Well Stan, I like how you always get right to the key elements. Youâve been very consistent with that over the years. So listen, weâre going to keep our options open, Stan. The - obviously in the period just ended, we spent $150 million on share repurchases. I believe we are seeing a good deal flow and opportunity. So we will probably have probably I would say a very balanced approach between returning capital and opportunistically investing.
I mean the leverage - I joined the Company we have leveraged ratio of 40% debt-to-total capitalization and weâve really never been below 30 since Iâve been at the Company and here we are today at 11%. So we have a lot of flexibility and weâre going to hopefully make some intelligent moves here.
Stan Mann
Okay. My second question maybe looking out quite a distance, but do you have any goal or feel for what your operating margins will go to in future years, I mean you are kind of targeting orâ¦?
David Storch
Yes, we have a three-year plan that gets us up to our 10% objective.
Stan Mann
Oh, well thatâs really optimistic.
David Storch
Right, right but it is real and we have to win some business, and yes but we feel we can get there.
Stan Mann 
Okay. Good job.
David Storch
By the way we've lowered our corporate expense by $8.2 million in the quarter. So going forward our corporate expense will be as I said lowered by $8.2 million.
Stan Mann
Thatâs a good number. Itâs hard to discern what the exact numbers are, but thatâs really quite a move in the right direction.
David Storch
Yes.
Stan Mann 
Thank you. Good job.
David Storch
Yes, thanks.
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question is a followup from the line of Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Robert Spingarn
Hi, good morning again.
David Storch
Good morning.
Robert Spingarn
So back to the comment on the healthy airline industry, weâve all seen is how is that translating in MRO, you mentioned a moment ago that supply chain is really the driver in the segment, but in MRO, is there a way to think about same-store sales so to speak in terms of growth?
David Storch
I mean the, the way to think about the MRO is probably the hours of maintenance and the cumulative man hours and that number has been a little bit down and give or take itâs around the $5 million level and so thatâs one of the reasons why we took the action we did with Hot Springs to reduce some of our footprint and get more productivity our of our remaining footprint. 
So weâre also trying to find the lowest cost solution. One of the reasons why we moved into Lake Charles was to get a lot [ph] capacity at a low expense. Now we've got to make sure we can, as John Holmes indicated make sure we can get the workforce in place to make that business hum.
Robert Spingarn
So David, maybe you can help me reconcile, we got seat miles raising 5%, 6%, 7% depending on where youâre looking and why would maintenance hours be down?
David Storch
Just where the aircrafts are in the repair cycle as well as capacity in North America.
Robert Spingarn
Is there any element of fleet age playing a role here?
David Storch
Not, not, really I think the average age, the fleet age I think has been, again using my historical knowledge, I donât think that has been more than a one year average age variation over the last 25 years.
Robert Spingarn
Okay.
David Storch
But, if I mean the average age is, and donât quote me exactly thatâs, if itâs 12.9 years or 13.2 or 12.7 it really doesnât make, it really doesnât play a factor here.

Robert Spingarn
Well, I mean a lot of airlines have been addressing or avoiding maintenance by parking aircraft that are due for heavy checks, I mean has that been an element?
David Storch
We havenât really seen much of that.
Robert Spingarn
Okay. And then just a last question on this David, so it sounds like your approach to guiding for this year reflects some of the variability in Expeditionary you want to get a little further into the year before you look there or make specific targets, but on the aviation side is there some framework we can think about in terms of growth expectation and sales expectations?
David Storch
Well, weâre looking at double-digit sales growth and weâre looking at double-digit earnings growth from those businesses.
Robert Spingarn
And again this is driven by supply chain rather than MRO?
David Storch
No, weâre looking for improvement in MRO as well, so weâre looking for improvement or growth, I should say in both.
Robert Spingarn
Okay. Okay. And then last questionâ¦
David Storch
MRO is not earning at peak levels right now. So we have had higher earnings levels at MRO than we are currently experiencing.
Robert Spingarn
Okay, I was going to ask you just one last question on this. John and Iâve talked in the past about capacity utilization, where would you say you would be once you close the facility youâre closing in terms of MRO?
David Storch
At 70%.
Robert Spingarn
Okay, okay. Thank you.
David Storch
Yep.
Operator
Thank you. And we have a follow-up question from the line of Kevin Ciabattoni with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Kevin Ciabattoni
Hi, thanks guys, thanks for taking my followup here.
David Storch
Sure.
Kevin Ciabattoni
You mentioned some restructuring in the landing gear business, just kind of wondering if you can maybe give us some color on what happened there and if youâre seeing any pickup there in terms of the cyclicality of that business?
David Storch
Yes, so we are, we have exited certain product lines that we viewed non-productive and we are seeing an uptick in the cycle. We expect that to kick in more so as the fiscal year moves forward. So, think of it as a 10-year cycle. So if you look at deliveries at the factories 10 years back they were starting to pick up in the â05 time period and so we should start seeing â05, â06. We should start seeing you know improvement in that operation.
Kevin Ciabattoni
Okay, thanks David, and then just my last question I guess. Looking at Airlift and the contracting environment, is there a specific reason you can point to that the contracts are taking longer to get through the finish line here than kind of what you had originally thought?. And then as a second part of that question, is there any impact on how that plays out that you see from the FY â16 federal budget process or is that kind of separate from that I guess?
David Storch
No, I think itâs all kind of connected. My sense is that, there are clearly operational needs that the customers had, that the customers has, customer being USTRANSCOM for the most part. So just there are delays in funding and preparations I believe that have had some impact. So yes, I mean itâs kind of, - I donât think anything specific to AAR that you wonât be seeing in other government contracting environments.
Kevin Ciabattoni
Great, thanks.
David Storch
Yes.
Operator
Thank you. And that does conclude todayâs question-and-answer portion. I would like to turn the call back over to David Storch for any closing remarks.
David Storch
Thank you very much for your participation today, and I look forward to our next call in September. Have a nice afternoon. Bye-bye.

Groh - D.A. DavidsonOperatorGood afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to AAR's Fiscal 2016 First Quarter Earnings Call. We are joined today by David Storch, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; John Fortson, Chief Financial Officer; Tim Romenesko, Vice Chairman and Chief Operating Officer of Expeditionary Services; John Holmes, Chief Operating Officer of Aviation Services; and Mike Sharp, Chief Accounting Officer and Controller.Before we begin, I like to remind you that comments made during the call may include forward-looking statements as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as noted in our news release and the risk factor section of the company's form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2015. In providing forward-looking statements, the company assumes no obligation to provide updates to reflect future circumstances or anticipated or unanticipated events.At this time, I'd like turn the call over to AAR's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, David Storch.David StorchThank you, sir, and good afternoon to those attending today. And thank you for joining us to discuss the first quarter results. I am traveling today, so I am not in our corporate offices, but John, Tim, John Holmes and Mike Sharp are. So I'll direct the questions as questions are fired. If you have any direct questions for any of the guys, please feel free to ask them directly.Generally speaking, our first quarter was in line with internal expectations. If I may, just commenting on the businesses, aviation services sales saw an increase of $4.2 million compared to the prior year quarter.Our distribution program businesses were strong, they delivered solid results. Distribution business grew. Its customer based, and is actually achieving slightly above plan. Our program activity is strong, as well.Unfortunately, our trading business did experience some softness and performed below our internal expectations. But we do expect to rebound in the second quarter. And you may recall the trading businesses are really the ad hoc parts.Supply businesses, some of the engine shop activity that we normally support or that we do support was a little softer this summer than we had expected. We also began, during the period - although revenue will start in Q2, we started the ramp for our C-130 program in Afghanistan.We have our first wave of people in country now, and those revenues, in the past, I think we've indicated about $30 million contract. We are now expecting that contract to be roughly in the range of $50 million or $10 million a year. It's a 5 year contract and we should start seeing revenue in Q2.In our MRO network, we experienced a higher utilization. You recall summer months are usually a little tougher, as the airlines like to keep the aircraft flying during the summer. So we were - we did take on some work that, in the past, we hadnât taken on, which is doing completion work and mod work for customer aircraft entering service. And so we had a - generally speaking a pretty decent summer period.We completed the consolidations of our Hot Springs business into our Oklahoma City business. We did incur a $1.9 million one time cost, most of which was absorbed during the quarter. And going forward, we expect annual savings of about $1.5 million from this consolidation.Also, our Lake Charles business was pretty busy during the summer, and did contribute to our earnings, where in the past they had been a drag on earnings. Now as we look ahead, our book is filling nicely and we are experiencing and seeing a fairly robust pipeline for our MRO services.Moving over to our Expeditionary Service business, sales were $21.5 million below the prior year, mostly due to the mix of flying positions in airlift, and lower mobility product volumes. While airlift was down year-over-year, performance was up on a sequential basis.And during the quarter, we commenced operations on two new contracts, including our United Nations contract in Africa. And I might be able to report here that the customer is very pleased with the service that we've offered to date.As we move on, on that business, we are looking to expand the contract and fleet. And we have again, in this business, a pretty robust pipeline of activity. And as we've communicated before, we will be commencing our Falkland Island search and rescue contract, as a contractor to the UK MOD. And that contract will begin work in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year.And itâs a fairly meaningful contract for the company. Our first contract of this type outside the United States or I should say with a customer outside of the United States, other than the United Nations contract, and we're very encouraged by what we see.Now, we will be incurring training costs and positioning costs in our Q2 and Q3, but we will be seeing good revenue stream and healthy margins coming out starting in Q4 and you may recall that is a 10 year contract. So feel good about where we stand there.Mobility continues to be impacted by low defense spending, and then during the quarter we did take some actions to right-size our overhead. Bookings appear to be on a slightly positive trend now, but growth in that business does remain a challenge for the near term.So with that, pretty much on balance, I am pleased with Q1 results. And as previously indicated we see a strong ramp in the second half of our fiscal year. We do expect sequential growth in sales and earnings, Q2 over Q1, but getting to levels that we feel good about by our Q3 and Q4 time periods.We feel very good about our balance sheet and our unused capacity and our abilities to move swiftly. I think we indicated during - in the earnings call that our debt to total capitalization is in the 15% range. And it gives us a lot of flexibility to take advantage of any opportunities that emerge, as a result of some financial uncertainty around the universe.So yes, I think we're entering Q2 in a good position. Should see, as I indicated, better results Q2 over Q1, and then getting to pretty improved, more consistent results by Q3 and then into Q4.So we communicated this. You may recall back in the March time period, we've gone through some significant change at the company. We feel really good about what we've done, and we feel really good about where we're positioned for the future.So with that, what I'd like to do is turn the call over to John, to fill you in on some of the - more of the financials, and then open it up to the Q&A.John FortsonThanks, David. Good afternoon, everyone. I trust in each of you had a chance to read our earnings release. I'll talk about our financial performance in a little more detail. Let me start by saying that our sales for the quarter of $377.8 million were 4.4% less than our prior year sales.As David mentioned, we grew aviation services by $4.2 million, or 1.3%, year-over-year. Our expeditionary services segment, however, declined by 25.7% year-over-year. As expected, however, this segment grew 11.5% on a sequential basis due to the new fleet positions that David discussed at airlift.On the profitability side, our results were impacted by the softness in trading, and by the contract mix at airlift. Our gross profit margin was 14.4% consisting of 15.8% margin in aviation services, and 7.4% margin in expeditionary services.SG&A as a percentage of sales in the first quarter was 10.4%. This is higher than it has been in recent quarters, due to increased legal expenses, some of which will recur in the second quarter.Partially offsetting these increases was the realization of our corporate savings from actions we took in fiscal year 2015. Depreciation and amortization, including the amortization of stock-based compensation was $14.7 million for the quarter. For the first quarter, our effective tax rate was 34.9%.During the quarter the company used $63.7 million in cash flow from operations, due to investments in our supply chain business, a large tax payment, and the timing of receipts in MRO and at airlift.Capital expenditures for the quarter were $15 million. Net debt grew $51.5 million from last quarter to end at $150.8 million. During the quarter, we paid $2.6 million in dividends, and repurchased approximately 300,000 shares for $7.1 million.We also bought back 14.4 million of our convertible notes that are due in March of 2016. We started fiscal '16 with 35.1 million shares in the diluted share count, and we ended the quarter with 35.1 million shares.Finally, we have 22 aircraft under contract today versus 19 on August 31, 2014. Note that we plan to add two leased aircraft to the fleet by the end of the calendar year to serve under the Falkland Islands contract that David was referring to.Thanks for your attention, and I'll turn the call back over to David, or we can go straight to Q&A.David StorchThanks, John. So why don't we move on to the Q&A, please.Question-and-Answer SessionOperator[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn from Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.Robert SpingarnHi, everybody. Hopefully you can hear me.David StorchCan hear you.Robert SpingarnOkay. Good. That's what I was looking for. I wanted to make sure we are connected. So that was a nice rebound there, modest rebound I should say and expeditionary I was owing to ask David and or John if you could talk about what we should expect in terms of flying position, as we go through the year you mentioned the leased aircraft, and so we're 22 now which I think is one above where we were July the last time we talked to you on one of these calls.How do we â how does the year play out here and how should we think about you know getting from a 7.5% gross margin, do we go back to the mid to high teens? How do we think about, can you frame that?David StorchJohn Fortson, would you answer that please?John FortsonSure. We are not giving guidance for the rest of the fiscal year. Obviously we have a business plan out there and we expect to see continued growth in our flying positions. You can extrapolate from the numbers that we've given you. Itâs not too hard to envision that we could be in the sort of the mid to high 20 aircraft positions if some things go according to plan. But obviously there's execution risk in Afghanistan as well.So we feel good about where the fleet sits today. I do think from a mix perspective some of the contracts that we have today, we lost a couple of the very profitable S-92's and so thatâs impacting the mix unfavorably from a margin perspective.But I think that as the fleet gets back to a more normalized level in the back part of the year you're going to see that - those margins improve.Robert SpingarnRight. Because when I look at the revenues on a year-on-year basis they are almost flatâ¦John FortsonRight.Robert Spingarn316 versus 318, but the profit is about a third of was it was back then, 7% versus 18%. So what you are saying is we'll see some mix improve. We don't have to get triple the sales to get the same amount of profit?John FortsonNo. Look. I think that's right. I think you'll see some mix improve. I think we've got some operational opportunities to improve the efficiencies of our fleet in different geographies and then obviously as other contracts come on board that we expect to see that will help it as well.Robert SpingarnOkay. And then just the reluctance to go out with specific guidance. I don't know David maybe this is for you. But what - where does the hesitation come from?David StorchWell, I mean, we've been through a fairly significant transformation at the company. So my preference is to let the dust settle. I think as we progress throughout the year I think we'll be in a better position to offer up guidance.So I think we indicated back in March that we were going to take a pause from guidance between now and through the second quarter of this fiscal year. And I'd like to stick with that at this point. So I think we'll have a lot more visibility come the second half of the year.We have to get all of our cost to flow through. We have a lot of one time exceptional costs and we want to get our hands around those and then we do have, as I indicate, a fairly robust pipeline inside of the airlift business and we want to see how that flushes out as well.Robert SpingarnOkay. Fair enough. I'll pass it to the next person. Thank you.David StorchGreat.OperatorAnd our next question comes from the line of Larry Solow from CJS Securities. Please proceed.Larry SolowOkay. Great, thanks. Good afternoon, guys. On aviation services, David. I was wondering maybe if you could to sort of parcel out your thoughts for the remainder of the year. So I guess Q1 was a little weaker on your trading end of business and I guess that sort of translate to some of the weakness. Some of your â some of the other aftermarket providers have seen.Is that correct and what sort of gives you confidence that itâs a temporary thing, is it just sort of your - the air miles and capacity still remains strong? Soâ¦David StorchYes. So I mean, I have a little bit of advantage over others in that I've seen this movie for the last 37 years.Larry SolowAbsolutely.David StorchSo you know my sense is that we've had a little bit of a low. I've seen these before. My - in talking with some customers and talking with our people I get a sense that things - and I already see in the month of September that we are seeing some improvement. Now I am not excited yetâ¦Larry SolowOkayâ¦David StorchBut I do believe that the - that we will see strengthening throughout the balance of the year and that, the first quarter was a little rough, but my sense is air miles havenât really diminished much and what you would say the fleet age really hasn't changed a lot.And I think similar what you see with Southwest we're taking 737, 700s and putting them to work. I think my sense is that, thatâs more of the norm than the - not then something out of the norm. So my view is that, yes, we'll see strengthening as the year progresses.Larry SolowOkay. And not to hold you to this. I know it was in the guidance number, but on the last call is sort of two out sort of a double-digit sales expectation. You don't have to necessarily confirm that, but it sounds like you are still pretty confident that whether it's 10, 8 or 9 or whatever that you are pretty confident in the overall outlook is thatâ¦David StorchYes I am.Larry SolowOkay. And then on the MRO side, nice to see Lake Charles actually turn positive. Is that - you know just the tip of the iceberg? How does the backlog looked they are and what your expectations as we go out?David StorchWell, I believe that Lake Charles itself if I were to isolate Lake Charles it still have certain risks associated with it because we're still trying to get a normalized pattern going there. We came to the quarter I think in good shape and we have some opportunism. But I'd like to hold back, reserve my comment on that until I see another quarter or two under our - have another quarter or two under our belts. So in general though if I can comment on MRO in generalâ¦Larry SolowAbsolutelyâ¦David StorchI feel very good about our prospects. And we are having good interaction with our customers. We're getting a sense that there is a fair amount of demand penting â thatâs pent-up and we expect good solid results through the balance of the fiscal year from our MRO activities.Larry SolowAnd on prior calls, I think if we go back even several quarters back, landing gear we had some slowness and it was - you had discussed it sort of being a cyclical downturn. Have we seen sort of the inflection point or do you still expect that to â is that part of your positive outlook?David StorchWell, not as much as it is on the heavy maintenance side. However, we do see a better, let's say Q2 over Q1. But still not satisfied with the level of input and still not achieving the same levels we've had in the past. So I'd like to reserve my comments there as well.Larry SolowOkay. And just on the SG&A line, I think you - there was the â with the severance for the consolidation and the MRO space was that $1.9 million was that actually - you didnât pull that out as non-recurring, right?David StorchYes. Some of that occurred in SG&A and some of that occurred in direct expense.Larry SolowGot you.David StorchAnd the biggest thing right on - that would be unusual in the SG&A would be the legal costs that we've - some of the legal costs that we've incurred.Larry SolowRight. Okay. And just last, and I don't want you - I know you put out a comment yesterday in terms of the - some of the legal stuff going on in your expeditionary services. So I realize you probably can't comment on that or where we stand with the State Department contract.One thing that sort of [copy] [ph] by surprise and I don't know if you can care to comment on it at all. But on your website I see you are sort of soliciting for a potential employment, and you still say that decision hasnât been made, so that disclaimer is clear. But can I read anything into that other than you just â or you just being prepared in case you get that contract any thoughts?David StorchYes. Yes. We're getting - that's in preparation in the event that we've been in that [contract] [ph] That's correct.Larry SolowOkay. Great. Thanks, David.David StorchYes.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Kevin Ciabattoni [KeyBanc Capital Markets]. Please proceed with your question.Kevin CiabattoniHi. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking my questions here.David StorchHi, Kevin.Kevin CiabattoniJust to follow up on Rob's first question on airlift. I know last quarter you talked a lot about the startup costs associated with some of these new contracts.Just curious if you saw any of that flow through here in 1Q and maybe what we can expect â should we expect margins to maybe get in 2Q with similar to startup cost creep up?David StorchTim Romenesko, do you want to take that question?Timothy RomeneskoSure. So we are expecting to have startup costs on the [Falkland's] [ph] program in Q2 and Q3 and it will be $3 million to $4 million. Its people cost, its training costs, its positioning cost. And so we think that that will have an impact between Q2 and Q3 and then Q4 when the program starts obviously those costs go away and then we flip around into profitability.So those are the - that's the biggest startup costs that we're seeing in front of us for the balance of the fiscal year.Kevin CiabattoniAnd is that $3 million to $4 million cumulatively or per quarterâ¦Timothy RomeneskoYes. No. Cumulativelyâ¦Kevin CiabattoniOkayâ¦Timothy RomeneskoSpread over the two quarters.Kevin CiabattoniOkay, thanks. You know any particular - you touched a little bit on the weakness in trading that I assume impacted supply chain and kind of the flat quarter year-over-year. I mean, was there anything else in supply chain in the quarter that was - that kind of came in below expectations and then anything specific in that trading business that caused that?David StorchJohn Holmes, do you want answer that question?John HolmesSure. Sure. Outside of trading, the rest of aviation services actually came in at or above expectations. Trading was the single area that was below and there really was not one single product or category that was soft. We felt it in multiple ways across the business, both on the engine parts and airframe part side.The only thing I would say is that in certain areas we saw weak demand and we had supply and in other areas we saw strong demand, but werenât able to get our hands on the material to fill that demand. So we had a couple of different dynamics going there.Kevin CiabattoniOkay. That's helpful. Thanks. You mentioned in the press release and on the call I think John this is probably directed at you, some investment, inventory investment for supply chain.Was that related to contract ones that you've already announced or business that you are kind of going after that we havenât seen flow through yet?John FortsonThatâs contract wins that are already announced. So building off of programs that have already been one and those investments online with the plan.Kevin CiabattoniOkay. And then last one for me and I'll jump back in queue. Any color you can give on your thoughts around maybe additional stock repurchase activity going forward here just kind of based on where the stock is relative to where it was when we last talked?David StorchI'll take that one. And we will watch that closely. We have about 95 million left on our authorization and we will look at that closely.Kevin CiabattoniOkay. Thanks.Operator[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of J.B. Groh from D.A. Davidson. Please proceed with your question.J.B. GrohHey John, I just wanted to clarify on the SG&A, you had some of that legal, [legal] [ph] is all in SG&A and the severance is split into the segments?John FortsonYes, that's right. That's right.J.B. GrohOkay. So what's the appropriate level SG&A kind of on a go forward basis based on the â you had a pretty nice decline here quarter-to-quarter?John FortsonWell, we'd like to get it down. We've historically operated and called in the sort of 9.5% range and anything north of that we're sort of not happy with. But I think we want to be clear. I mean some of these legal expenses we expect to sort of continue for a while.J.B. GrohOkay. So those will persist forâ¦John FortsonA couple of quarters, I would think.J.B. GrohOkay. Okay. Thanks. That's all I had.Operator[Operator Instructions] Our next question is a follow up question from the line of Robert Spingarn. Please proceed with your question.Robert SpingarnOkay. So David or John, I am back with just some cadence questions. David you said earlier Q2 is going to be a little better sequentially than Q1 and then you are going to have more consistent results for Q3 and Q4, the kind of results that you would feel good about.Can you give us a little better sense of what that actually means in terms just relative to Q1?David StorchI would expect that through the balance of the year we will continue to see improving results. Andâ¦Robert SpingarnThat part I got.David StorchYes.Robert SpingarnSo I'm looking at $0.23 in Q1â¦David StorchRight.Robert SpingarnI've got a 7% margin in Expeditionary. I think John was saying that will go up, though it sounds like it may go down before it goes up?John FortsonIn the back part of the year, Robert.David StorchRight.Robert SpingarnOkay. Okay. So let's just start there. Does that mean that Expeditionary is a negative gross margin in Q2?David StorchNot to our expectations.Robert SpingarnOkay. Because you can absorb a couple million dollars or half of that cost you talked about and still be slightly positive?David StorchThat's correctâ¦Robert SpingarnOkay.David StorchWe expect to be positive in Q2.Robert SpingarnPositive and then similarly positive in Q3 within a real nice number in Q4? Is that how I think of that Expeditionary profit?David StorchYes.Robert SpingarnOkay. Okay. Fair enough. And then on the aviation side, given the fact that some businesses were better than expected, others were worse. Is that profitability level - is $50 million in gross profit per quarter kind of a steady run rate here or is it going up?David StorchWe expect to do better.Robert SpingarnOkay. And just cadence wise how do we think about each of the other quarters. Do you expect to do better, sort of similar jumps per quarter or is it back ended?David StorchWell, I think you are going to see a improvement, a steady improvement in Q2 and then hopefully you see more meaningful improvements in Q3 and Q4.Robert SpingarnOkayâ¦David StorchAnd what I was referring to, Rob, is more from a historical perspective. I think we get into historical return levels by Q3.Robert SpingarnBy Q - that kind of a run rate which would then mean and I don't want to get too far ahead of ourselves that next year, presuming things go the right way you can actually get to a full year type of historical level?David StorchYes. Correct.Robert SpingarnOkay, thank you.David StorchYes. And yes, correct.Robert SpingarnOkay.David StorchYes. So we're seeing - just so everyone is clear. We're seeing strength in our businesses in the commercial markets. We see opportunities in the airlift market. We have softness in the defense spending for our mobility businesses. That would be I would say a general overview of our businesses.And we would expect that the supply chain business will continue to improve, as well as the MRO businesses and we see a little bit of choppiness though in the airlift business. We feel better about that once we have the Falklands contract operating versus you know, spending money to get ready for it to operate.Robert SpingarnRight. I don't know if I am still connected here. But does that - it sounds to me, David, what you are saying is when you get all that together again you are back to doing $0.50 a quarter and maybe better.But the next quarter or two are going to be â won't be quite there, there will be somewhere between the $0.23 you just did and that target of $0.50, $0.60 a quarter?David StorchI think that's a good way to look at it.Robert SpingarnOkay. Thank you.OperatorAnd our next question comes from the line of Larry Solow from CJS. Please proceed with your question.Larry SolowDavid, just a quick follow-up, just on the mobility business. Obviously, it continues to remain soft. Do you think we are close to the bottom or obviously it's hard to predict a rebound, especiallyâ¦David StorchYes. We predicted close to bottom before andâ¦Larry SolowNo, I donâtâ¦David StorchSurprise ourselves. So what I would like to do is just wait and see how the government reacts to all the different skirmishes and activity around the world. Right now they've been very passive as you know and thatâs impacted our business.If, in fact, troop levels stay steady or strengthen and we actually put troops, move troops around, it should spell opportunity for our business. But we've been a little bit surprised at the softness and don't know precisely if we are at bottom. But maybe Tim Romenesko, maybe he can give a little more color on that, if you donât mind.Timothy RomeneskoDavid is right. We predicted the bottom before and we've been wrong. We are seeing a little bit of year end activity around a couple of product lines. But other product lines are pretty quiet. So I think David's characterization is right on.Larry SolowAnd the legal expenses, I mean, you've not given an exact number, is it somewhere around $2 million, $3 million something per quarter or is thatâ¦David StorchNot that high.Larry SolowNot that high. Okay. Okay, thanks.Operator[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Ciabattoni [KeyBanc Capital Markets]. Please proceed.Kevin CiabattoniHey, thanks. One quick follow-up. I just wanted to touch base on the ExpressJet agreement with Airinmar that you guys recently. It seems like a pretty nice win. They've got a fairly sizable fleet. You know is that new work for you guys or something that you've been doing with them in the past?David StorchJohn Holmes?John HolmesYes. Sure. That is new work. That's a new contract. The scope of that is - and I would characterize it as a modest start. But there is an opportunity to add on the rest of that Airinmar services with SkyWest, ExpressJet jet. So that is a new win for that business.Kevin CiabattoniGreat. Thanks. That's all I have.OperatorThank you. And that concludes today's question and answer session. I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Storch for any closing remarks.David StorchWell, thank you very much. Thank you for your attendance today and thanks for your very thoughtful questions.

Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to AAR's Fiscal 2016 First Quarter Earnings Call. We are joined today by David Storch, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; John Fortson, Chief Financial Officer; Tim Romenesko, Vice Chairman and Chief Operating Officer of Expeditionary Services; John Holmes, Chief Operating Officer of Aviation Services; and Mike Sharp, Chief Accounting Officer and Controller.
Before we begin, I like to remind you that comments made during the call may include forward-looking statements as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as noted in our news release and the risk factor section of the company's form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2015. In providing forward-looking statements, the company assumes no obligation to provide updates to reflect future circumstances or anticipated or unanticipated events.
At this time, I'd like turn the call over to AAR's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, David Storch.
David Storch
Thank you, sir, and good afternoon to those attending today. And thank you for joining us to discuss the first quarter results. I am traveling today, so I am not in our corporate offices, but John, Tim, John Holmes and Mike Sharp are. So I'll direct the questions as questions are fired. If you have any direct questions for any of the guys, please feel free to ask them directly.
Generally speaking, our first quarter was in line with internal expectations. If I may, just commenting on the businesses, aviation services sales saw an increase of $4.2 million compared to the prior year quarter.
Our distribution program businesses were strong, they delivered solid results. Distribution business grew. Its customer based, and is actually achieving slightly above plan. Our program activity is strong, as well.
Unfortunately, our trading business did experience some softness and performed below our internal expectations. But we do expect to rebound in the second quarter. And you may recall the trading businesses are really the ad hoc parts.
Supply businesses, some of the engine shop activity that we normally support or that we do support was a little softer this summer than we had expected. We also began, during the period - although revenue will start in Q2, we started the ramp for our C-130 program in Afghanistan.
We have our first wave of people in country now, and those revenues, in the past, I think we've indicated about $30 million contract. We are now expecting that contract to be roughly in the range of $50 million or $10 million a year. It's a 5 year contract and we should start seeing revenue in Q2.
In our MRO network, we experienced a higher utilization. You recall summer months are usually a little tougher, as the airlines like to keep the aircraft flying during the summer. So we were - we did take on some work that, in the past, we hadnât taken on, which is doing completion work and mod work for customer aircraft entering service. And so we had a - generally speaking a pretty decent summer period.
We completed the consolidations of our Hot Springs business into our Oklahoma City business. We did incur a $1.9 million one time cost, most of which was absorbed during the quarter. And going forward, we expect annual savings of about $1.5 million from this consolidation.

Also, our Lake Charles business was pretty busy during the summer, and did contribute to our earnings, where in the past they had been a drag on earnings. Now as we look ahead, our book is filling nicely and we are experiencing and seeing a fairly robust pipeline for our MRO services.
Moving over to our Expeditionary Service business, sales were $21.5 million below the prior year, mostly due to the mix of flying positions in airlift, and lower mobility product volumes. While airlift was down year-over-year, performance was up on a sequential basis.
And during the quarter, we commenced operations on two new contracts, including our United Nations contract in Africa. And I might be able to report here that the customer is very pleased with the service that we've offered to date.
As we move on, on that business, we are looking to expand the contract and fleet. And we have again, in this business, a pretty robust pipeline of activity. And as we've communicated before, we will be commencing our Falkland Island search and rescue contract, as a contractor to the UK MOD. And that contract will begin work in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year.
And itâs a fairly meaningful contract for the company. Our first contract of this type outside the United States or I should say with a customer outside of the United States, other than the United Nations contract, and we're very encouraged by what we see.
Now, we will be incurring training costs and positioning costs in our Q2 and Q3, but we will be seeing good revenue stream and healthy margins coming out starting in Q4 and you may recall that is a 10 year contract. So feel good about where we stand there.
Mobility continues to be impacted by low defense spending, and then during the quarter we did take some actions to right-size our overhead. Bookings appear to be on a slightly positive trend now, but growth in that business does remain a challenge for the near term.
So with that, pretty much on balance, I am pleased with Q1 results. And as previously indicated we see a strong ramp in the second half of our fiscal year. We do expect sequential growth in sales and earnings, Q2 over Q1, but getting to levels that we feel good about by our Q3 and Q4 time periods.
We feel very good about our balance sheet and our unused capacity and our abilities to move swiftly. I think we indicated during - in the earnings call that our debt to total capitalization is in the 15% range. And it gives us a lot of flexibility to take advantage of any opportunities that emerge, as a result of some financial uncertainty around the universe.
So yes, I think we're entering Q2 in a good position. Should see, as I indicated, better results Q2 over Q1, and then getting to pretty improved, more consistent results by Q3 and then into Q4.
So we communicated this. You may recall back in the March time period, we've gone through some significant change at the company. We feel really good about what we've done, and we feel really good about where we're positioned for the future.
So with that, what I'd like to do is turn the call over to John, to fill you in on some of the - more of the financials, and then open it up to the Q&A.
John Fortson
Thanks, David. Good afternoon, everyone. I trust in each of you had a chance to read our earnings release. I'll talk about our financial performance in a little more detail. Let me start by saying that our sales for the quarter of $377.8 million were 4.4% less than our prior year sales.
As David mentioned, we grew aviation services by $4.2 million, or 1.3%, year-over-year. Our expeditionary services segment, however, declined by 25.7% year-over-year. As expected, however, this segment grew 11.5% on a sequential basis due to the new fleet positions that David discussed at airlift.

On the profitability side, our results were impacted by the softness in trading, and by the contract mix at airlift. Our gross profit margin was 14.4% consisting of 15.8% margin in aviation services, and 7.4% margin in expeditionary services.
SG&A as a percentage of sales in the first quarter was 10.4%. This is higher than it has been in recent quarters, due to increased legal expenses, some of which will recur in the second quarter.
Partially offsetting these increases was the realization of our corporate savings from actions we took in fiscal year 2015. Depreciation and amortization, including the amortization of stock-based compensation was $14.7 million for the quarter. For the first quarter, our effective tax rate was 34.9%.
During the quarter the company used $63.7 million in cash flow from operations, due to investments in our supply chain business, a large tax payment, and the timing of receipts in MRO and at airlift.
Capital expenditures for the quarter were $15 million. Net debt grew $51.5 million from last quarter to end at $150.8 million. During the quarter, we paid $2.6 million in dividends, and repurchased approximately 300,000 shares for $7.1 million.
We also bought back 14.4 million of our convertible notes that are due in March of 2016. We started fiscal '16 with 35.1 million shares in the diluted share count, and we ended the quarter with 35.1 million shares.
Finally, we have 22 aircraft under contract today versus 19 on August 31, 2014. Note that we plan to add two leased aircraft to the fleet by the end of the calendar year to serve under the Falkland Islands contract that David was referring to.
Thanks for your attention, and I'll turn the call back over to David, or we can go straight to Q&A.
David Storch
Thanks, John. So why don't we move on to the Q&A, please.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn from Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.
Robert Spingarn
Hi, everybody. Hopefully you can hear me.
David Storch
Can hear you.
Robert Spingarn
Okay. Good. That's what I was looking for. I wanted to make sure we are connected. So that was a nice rebound there, modest rebound I should say and expeditionary I was owing to ask David and or John if you could talk about what we should expect in terms of flying position, as we go through the year you mentioned the leased aircraft, and so we're 22 now which I think is one above where we were July the last time we talked to you on one of these calls.
How do we â how does the year play out here and how should we think about you know getting from a 7.5% gross margin, do we go back to the mid to high teens? How do we think about, can you frame that?
David Storch
John Fortson, would you answer that please?
John Fortson
Sure. We are not giving guidance for the rest of the fiscal year. Obviously we have a business plan out there and we expect to see continued growth in our flying positions. You can extrapolate from the numbers that we've given you. Itâs not too hard to envision that we could be in the sort of the mid to high 20 aircraft positions if some things go according to plan. But obviously there's execution risk in Afghanistan as well.
So we feel good about where the fleet sits today. I do think from a mix perspective some of the contracts that we have today, we lost a couple of the very profitable S-92's and so thatâs impacting the mix unfavorably from a margin perspective.
But I think that as the fleet gets back to a more normalized level in the back part of the year you're going to see that - those margins improve.
Robert Spingarn
Right. Because when I look at the revenues on a year-on-year basis they are almost flatâ¦
John Fortson
Right.
Robert Spingarn
316 versus 318, but the profit is about a third of was it was back then, 7% versus 18%. So what you are saying is we'll see some mix improve. We don't have to get triple the sales to get the same amount of profit?

John Fortson
No. Look. I think that's right. I think you'll see some mix improve. I think we've got some operational opportunities to improve the efficiencies of our fleet in different geographies and then obviously as other contracts come on board that we expect to see that will help it as well.
Robert Spingarn
Okay. And then just the reluctance to go out with specific guidance. I don't know David maybe this is for you. But what - where does the hesitation come from?
David Storch
Well, I mean, we've been through a fairly significant transformation at the company. So my preference is to let the dust settle. I think as we progress throughout the year I think we'll be in a better position to offer up guidance.
So I think we indicated back in March that we were going to take a pause from guidance between now and through the second quarter of this fiscal year. And I'd like to stick with that at this point. So I think we'll have a lot more visibility come the second half of the year.
We have to get all of our cost to flow through. We have a lot of one time exceptional costs and we want to get our hands around those and then we do have, as I indicate, a fairly robust pipeline inside of the airlift business and we want to see how that flushes out as well.
Robert Spingarn
Okay. Fair enough. I'll pass it to the next person. Thank you.
David Storch
Great.
Operator
And our next question comes from the line of Larry Solow from CJS Securities. Please proceed.
Larry Solow
Okay. Great, thanks. Good afternoon, guys. On aviation services, David. I was wondering maybe if you could to sort of parcel out your thoughts for the remainder of the year. So I guess Q1 was a little weaker on your trading end of business and I guess that sort of translate to some of the weakness. Some of your â some of the other aftermarket providers have seen.
Is that correct and what sort of gives you confidence that itâs a temporary thing, is it just sort of your - the air miles and capacity still remains strong? Soâ¦
David Storch
Yes. So I mean, I have a little bit of advantage over others in that I've seen this movie for the last 37 years.
Larry Solow
Absolutely.
David Storch
So you know my sense is that we've had a little bit of a low. I've seen these before. My - in talking with some customers and talking with our people I get a sense that things - and I already see in the month of September that we are seeing some improvement. Now I am not excited yetâ¦
Larry Solow
Okayâ¦
David Storch
But I do believe that the - that we will see strengthening throughout the balance of the year and that, the first quarter was a little rough, but my sense is air miles havenât really diminished much and what you would say the fleet age really hasn't changed a lot.
And I think similar what you see with Southwest we're taking 737, 700s and putting them to work. I think my sense is that, thatâs more of the norm than the - not then something out of the norm. So my view is that, yes, we'll see strengthening as the year progresses.
Larry Solow
Okay. And not to hold you to this. I know it was in the guidance number, but on the last call is sort of two out sort of a double-digit sales expectation. You don't have to necessarily confirm that, but it sounds like you are still pretty confident that whether it's 10, 8 or 9 or whatever that you are pretty confident in the overall outlook is thatâ¦
David Storch
Yes I am.
Larry Solow
Okay. And then on the MRO side, nice to see Lake Charles actually turn positive. Is that - you know just the tip of the iceberg? How does the backlog looked they are and what your expectations as we go out?
David Storch
Well, I believe that Lake Charles itself if I were to isolate Lake Charles it still have certain risks associated with it because we're still trying to get a normalized pattern going there. We came to the quarter I think in good shape and we have some opportunism. But I'd like to hold back, reserve my comment on that until I see another quarter or two under our - have another quarter or two under our belts. So in general though if I can comment on MRO in generalâ¦

Larry Solow
Absolutelyâ¦
David Storch
I feel very good about our prospects. And we are having good interaction with our customers. We're getting a sense that there is a fair amount of demand penting â thatâs pent-up and we expect good solid results through the balance of the fiscal year from our MRO activities.
Larry Solow
And on prior calls, I think if we go back even several quarters back, landing gear we had some slowness and it was - you had discussed it sort of being a cyclical downturn. Have we seen sort of the inflection point or do you still expect that to â is that part of your positive outlook?
David Storch
Well, not as much as it is on the heavy maintenance side. However, we do see a better, let's say Q2 over Q1. But still not satisfied with the level of input and still not achieving the same levels we've had in the past. So I'd like to reserve my comments there as well.
Larry Solow
Okay. And just on the SG&A line, I think you - there was the â with the severance for the consolidation and the MRO space was that $1.9 million was that actually - you didnât pull that out as non-recurring, right?
David Storch
Yes. Some of that occurred in SG&A and some of that occurred in direct expense.
Larry Solow
Got you.
David Storch
And the biggest thing right on - that would be unusual in the SG&A would be the legal costs that we've - some of the legal costs that we've incurred.
Larry Solow
Right. Okay. And just last, and I don't want you - I know you put out a comment yesterday in terms of the - some of the legal stuff going on in your expeditionary services. So I realize you probably can't comment on that or where we stand with the State Department contract.
One thing that sort of [copy] [ph] by surprise and I don't know if you can care to comment on it at all. But on your website I see you are sort of soliciting for a potential employment, and you still say that decision hasnât been made, so that disclaimer is clear. But can I read anything into that other than you just â or you just being prepared in case you get that contract any thoughts?
David Storch
Yes. Yes. We're getting - that's in preparation in the event that we've been in that [contract] [ph] That's correct.
Larry Solow
Okay. Great. Thanks, David.
David Storch
Yes.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Ciabattoni [KeyBanc Capital Markets]. Please proceed with your question.
Kevin Ciabattoni
Hi. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking my questions here.
David Storch
Hi, Kevin.
Kevin Ciabattoni
Just to follow up on Rob's first question on airlift. I know last quarter you talked a lot about the startup costs associated with some of these new contracts.
Just curious if you saw any of that flow through here in 1Q and maybe what we can expect â should we expect margins to maybe get in 2Q with similar to startup cost creep up?
David Storch
Tim Romenesko, do you want to take that question?
Timothy Romenesko
Sure. So we are expecting to have startup costs on the [Falkland's] [ph] program in Q2 and Q3 and it will be $3 million to $4 million. Its people cost, its training costs, its positioning cost. And so we think that that will have an impact between Q2 and Q3 and then Q4 when the program starts obviously those costs go away and then we flip around into profitability.
So those are the - that's the biggest startup costs that we're seeing in front of us for the balance of the fiscal year.
Kevin Ciabattoni
And is that $3 million to $4 million cumulatively or per quarterâ¦
Timothy Romenesko
Yes. No. Cumulativelyâ¦
Kevin Ciabattoni
Okayâ¦
Timothy Romenesko
Spread over the two quarters.
Kevin Ciabattoni
Okay, thanks. You know any particular - you touched a little bit on the weakness in trading that I assume impacted supply chain and kind of the flat quarter year-over-year. I mean, was there anything else in supply chain in the quarter that was - that kind of came in below expectations and then anything specific in that trading business that caused that?

David Storch
John Holmes, do you want answer that question?
John Holmes
Sure. Sure. Outside of trading, the rest of aviation services actually came in at or above expectations. Trading was the single area that was below and there really was not one single product or category that was soft. We felt it in multiple ways across the business, both on the engine parts and airframe part side.
The only thing I would say is that in certain areas we saw weak demand and we had supply and in other areas we saw strong demand, but werenât able to get our hands on the material to fill that demand. So we had a couple of different dynamics going there.
Kevin Ciabattoni
Okay. That's helpful. Thanks. You mentioned in the press release and on the call I think John this is probably directed at you, some investment, inventory investment for supply chain.
Was that related to contract ones that you've already announced or business that you are kind of going after that we havenât seen flow through yet?
John Fortson
Thatâs contract wins that are already announced. So building off of programs that have already been one and those investments online with the plan.
Kevin Ciabattoni
Okay. And then last one for me and I'll jump back in queue. Any color you can give on your thoughts around maybe additional stock repurchase activity going forward here just kind of based on where the stock is relative to where it was when we last talked?
David Storch
I'll take that one. And we will watch that closely. We have about 95 million left on our authorization and we will look at that closely.
Kevin Ciabattoni
Okay. Thanks.
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of J.B. Groh from D.A. Davidson. Please proceed with your question.
J.B. Groh
Hey John, I just wanted to clarify on the SG&A, you had some of that legal, [legal] [ph] is all in SG&A and the severance is split into the segments?
John Fortson
Yes, that's right. That's right.
J.B. Groh
Okay. So what's the appropriate level SG&A kind of on a go forward basis based on the â you had a pretty nice decline here quarter-to-quarter?
John Fortson
Well, we'd like to get it down. We've historically operated and called in the sort of 9.5% range and anything north of that we're sort of not happy with. But I think we want to be clear. I mean some of these legal expenses we expect to sort of continue for a while.
J.B. Groh
Okay. So those will persist forâ¦
John Fortson
A couple of quarters, I would think.
J.B. Groh
Okay. Okay. Thanks. That's all I had.
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our next question is a follow up question from the line of Robert Spingarn. Please proceed with your question.
Robert Spingarn
Okay. So David or John, I am back with just some cadence questions. David you said earlier Q2 is going to be a little better sequentially than Q1 and then you are going to have more consistent results for Q3 and Q4, the kind of results that you would feel good about.
Can you give us a little better sense of what that actually means in terms just relative to Q1?
David Storch
I would expect that through the balance of the year we will continue to see improving results. Andâ¦
Robert Spingarn
That part I got.
David Storch
Yes.
Robert Spingarn
So I'm looking at $0.23 in Q1â¦
David Storch
Right.
Robert Spingarn
I've got a 7% margin in Expeditionary. I think John was saying that will go up, though it sounds like it may go down before it goes up?
John Fortson
In the back part of the year, Robert.
David Storch
Right.
Robert Spingarn
Okay. Okay. So let's just start there. Does that mean that Expeditionary is a negative gross margin in Q2?
David Storch
Not to our expectations.
Robert Spingarn
Okay. Because you can absorb a couple million dollars or half of that cost you talked about and still be slightly positive?
David Storch

That's correctâ¦
Robert Spingarn
Okay.
David Storch
We expect to be positive in Q2.
Robert Spingarn
Positive and then similarly positive in Q3 within a real nice number in Q4? Is that how I think of that Expeditionary profit?
David Storch
Yes.
Robert Spingarn
Okay. Okay. Fair enough. And then on the aviation side, given the fact that some businesses were better than expected, others were worse. Is that profitability level - is $50 million in gross profit per quarter kind of a steady run rate here or is it going up?
David Storch
We expect to do better.
Robert Spingarn
Okay. And just cadence wise how do we think about each of the other quarters. Do you expect to do better, sort of similar jumps per quarter or is it back ended?
David Storch
Well, I think you are going to see a improvement, a steady improvement in Q2 and then hopefully you see more meaningful improvements in Q3 and Q4.
Robert Spingarn
Okayâ¦
David Storch
And what I was referring to, Rob, is more from a historical perspective. I think we get into historical return levels by Q3.
Robert Spingarn
By Q - that kind of a run rate which would then mean and I don't want to get too far ahead of ourselves that next year, presuming things go the right way you can actually get to a full year type of historical level?
David Storch
Yes. Correct.
Robert Spingarn
Okay, thank you.
David Storch
Yes. And yes, correct.
Robert Spingarn
Okay.
David Storch
Yes. So we're seeing - just so everyone is clear. We're seeing strength in our businesses in the commercial markets. We see opportunities in the airlift market. We have softness in the defense spending for our mobility businesses. That would be I would say a general overview of our businesses.
And we would expect that the supply chain business will continue to improve, as well as the MRO businesses and we see a little bit of choppiness though in the airlift business. We feel better about that once we have the Falklands contract operating versus you know, spending money to get ready for it to operate.
Robert Spingarn
Right. I don't know if I am still connected here. But does that - it sounds to me, David, what you are saying is when you get all that together again you are back to doing $0.50 a quarter and maybe better.
But the next quarter or two are going to be â won't be quite there, there will be somewhere between the $0.23 you just did and that target of $0.50, $0.60 a quarter?
David Storch
I think that's a good way to look at it.
Robert Spingarn
Okay. Thank you.
Operator
And our next question comes from the line of Larry Solow from CJS. Please proceed with your question.
Larry Solow
David, just a quick follow-up, just on the mobility business. Obviously, it continues to remain soft. Do you think we are close to the bottom or obviously it's hard to predict a rebound, especiallyâ¦
David Storch
Yes. We predicted close to bottom before andâ¦
Larry Solow
No, I donâtâ¦
David Storch
Surprise ourselves. So what I would like to do is just wait and see how the government reacts to all the different skirmishes and activity around the world. Right now they've been very passive as you know and thatâs impacted our business.
If, in fact, troop levels stay steady or strengthen and we actually put troops, move troops around, it should spell opportunity for our business. But we've been a little bit surprised at the softness and don't know precisely if we are at bottom. But maybe Tim Romenesko, maybe he can give a little more color on that, if you donât mind.
Timothy Romenesko
David is right. We predicted the bottom before and we've been wrong. We are seeing a little bit of year end activity around a couple of product lines. But other product lines are pretty quiet. So I think David's characterization is right on.
Larry Solow
And the legal expenses, I mean, you've not given an exact number, is it somewhere around $2 million, $3 million something per quarter or is thatâ¦

David Storch
Not that high.
Larry Solow
Not that high. Okay. Okay, thanks.
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Ciabattoni [KeyBanc Capital Markets]. Please proceed.
Kevin Ciabattoni
Hey, thanks. One quick follow-up. I just wanted to touch base on the ExpressJet agreement with Airinmar that you guys recently. It seems like a pretty nice win. They've got a fairly sizable fleet. You know is that new work for you guys or something that you've been doing with them in the past?
David Storch
John Holmes?
John Holmes
Yes. Sure. That is new work. That's a new contract. The scope of that is - and I would characterize it as a modest start. But there is an opportunity to add on the rest of that Airinmar services with SkyWest, ExpressJet jet. So that is a new win for that business.
Kevin Ciabattoni
Great. Thanks. That's all I have.
Operator
Thank you. And that concludes today's question and answer session. I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Storch for any closing remarks.
David Storch
Well, thank you very much. Thank you for your attendance today and thanks for your very thoughtful questions. We remain very excited about our business. We feel really good about our position, feel really very positively about our balance sheet and the opportunity pull that we're looking at.

We are joined today by David Storch, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Mike Sharp, Chief Financial Officer; Tim Romenesko, Vice President and Chief Operating Officer of Expeditionary Services; and John Holmes, Chief Operating Officer of Aviation Services. 
Before we begin, I would like to remind you that comments made during the call may include forward-looking statements as defined by Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as noted in our news release and risk factor section of the company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2015.

At this time, I'd like turn the call over to AAR's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, David Storch.
David Storch
Thank you, sir, and good afternoon and thank you for joining us today to discuss our second quarter of fiscal 2016 results. Overall, as you can see, it was a strong quarter and top line growth and cash flow generation and performance was consistent with our expectation. I plan to share some of our highlights on business performance and I'll turn it over to Mike Sharp who will provide more detail on the financials and then we will come back to the Q&A.
First off, Aviation Services saw a growth in sales of $33.7 million on a comparative to prior year basis which was up 10.3% and just reiterating that's organic growth, no acquisitions in the period. Distribution programs delivered strong results again in both â supported both our commercial and government end markets as our innovative solutions and services are resonating with key customers.
During the period, our C-130 support program for the US Air Force in Afghanistan began generating revenue and we launched a repair management program for the Royal Saudi Air Force as a subcontractor to Northrop Grumman. We're experiencing improved operational performance on our largest airline consumable and expandable program.
Trading improved on a sequential basis, but was down year-over-year and across our one MRO network, we experienced double-digit growth driven largely by higher utilizations in our hangers. We continue air work in Lake Charles which reported a record top line this quarter and Duluth celebrated the completion of its 200th aircraft for Air Canada marking a new milestone in what has been a great customer relationship.
Landing gear repair was up 16% of the period on higher volumes. And looking ahead to the second half the year, we expect continuous strength in supply chain as we ramp some of our distribution program contracts and continued strength in MRO based on robust order book and increasing bid activity.
Expeditionary Services on the other hand saw a sales decline of $13.2 million from the prior year, largely due to lower demand and delayed decisions for program awards by our government customers. Airlift was down year-over-year, but performance was up slightly on a sequential basis. And during the quarter we were awarded extensions on our VERTREP program and we also started incurring costs associated with our MOD, British Ministry of Defense program support of the Falkland Search & Rescue contract.
Mobility also was negatively impacted by lower demand. However, our integrated technologies sub-business inside mobility did announce some contract wins during the period with US Air Force and US Army. As we look ahead to the second half of the fiscal year for this segment, our customers, although they foresee needs for airlift services, solicitations continue to be delayed largely due to insufficient funding and political uncertainty.

And due market headwinds, we do expect continuous softness in the third quarter for this segment and then some improvement come Q4 as the revenue for the MOD Search & Rescue contract kicks in. We continue to be market leaders in airlift mobility. We remain confident in our ability to win new awards when decisions are made and new RFPs hit the market.
So with that, if I may, let me turn it over to Mike and he can provide a little bit more financial color.
Mike Sharp
Thanks David, I trust that each of you have had an opportunity to review our earnings announcement. I want to discuss our second-quarter performance in a bit more detail and start by saying that sales for the quarter were $423.8 million, which is up on a consolidated basis, 5.1% over the prior year. As David mentioned, aviation services sales increased $33.7 million, up 10.3% year over year, while expeditionary services segment reported a 17% decline in sales.
The gross profit margin in aviation services was 16.2% this quarter compared to 16.5% last year. A slight decline in the margin year to year at aviation services was principally caused by mix within our supply chain activity reflecting increased program and distribution sales and less trading revenue. In the expeditionary services segment, the gross profit margin declined to 2.6% of sales caused by the decline in revenues, mix of business within the segment and as David mentioned start-up costs associated with the Falkland Islands contract. 
SG&A expenses in the period were 10% of sales compared to 10.4% in our first quarter. As many of you know, this ratio has historically run between 9% and 10% for the company. We feel good about our cost structure and the real opportunity for additional improvement in this ratio is by increasing sales.
Net interest expense was $1.5 million in the period compared to $6.5 million last year and reflects the significant decline in outstanding borrowings. Our effective tax rate for the period was 33.8% and includes a small favorable adjustment for our completed state tax audit. We expect our tax rate to approximate 35% in the back half of the year.
We had strong cash generation in the quarter generating a little under $48 million of cash from operations. Capital expenditures for the period were $15.7 million, inclusive of two payments on two AW189 rotary wing aircraft that was since sold and leased back. These are the two aircrafts we will be using on the British MOD contracts in the Falklands. 
Depreciation and amortization, including amortization of stock-based compensation was $14.3 million. Net debt declined $43.3 million from August 31, to end debt $107.5 million. During the period we bought back 9.7 million of our convertible notes. The remaining amount of the convertible notes is 25.7 million and will be retired March 1, 2016.
The book expense interest rate on these converts is 7.4% and we expect additional annual interest savings of approximately $1.4 million once these notes are retired in March. During the period, we paid $2.6 million of dividends and repurchased 142,000 shares in the open market for $2.8 million. As of November 30, there is a little over $91 million available under the Board authorized share repurchase plan.
Now thanks for your attention and I will turn the call now back over David. 
David Storch
Thanks Mike. So as you can see pretty good quarter, good double-digit organic growth in aviation services, good cash flow. Balance sheet is in wonderful position. Weâre kind of looking for ways to invest the capitals wisely. We do have some deal flow but we are staying very similar discipline in our deployment of capital.
So with that let me open up to any questions you might have.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] First question is from Larry Solow of CJS Securities. Your line is open.

Lee Jagoda
Hi, this is actually Lee Jagoda for Larry, good afternoon. Can you quantify the sort of expenses from the Falkland contract in the quarter and what if any additional expenses you might expect prior to the contract generating revenue?
David Storch
I mean we are not necessarily disclosing that this moment, but itâs not insignificant. Itâs a little bit â it will be higher in Q3 than it was in Q2, but then we will start, obviously as we start getting revenues in Q4, it turns from being a drag to being a contributor. 
Lee Jagoda
Sure. And then looking at Aviation Services, given that it sounds like the trading and parts business was actually a negative to the growth, what, in your opinion, is driving the strong growth? And how do you look at the sustainability of that going into the back half of the year?
David Storch
Well, I think weâve made a series of â we have had series of contract wins. I believe our business model is appealing to a broad range of customers commercially, and our commercial markets and defense customers. And yes, I think our team is doing a nice job, good leadership coming out of John Holmesâ office and his team surrounding him is executing and doing a good job.
Lee Jagoda
Okay. And one more from me and I'll hop back in queue. Are you guys seeing any of the benefits from lower oil prices and extending the useful lives of aircraft in the fleet?
David Storch
I donât really â I wonât have an answer for that, that would be quantitative in nature. My sense is that fleets are â that the airlines are adding capacity and more capacity is good for our business. 
Lee Jagoda
Fair enough. Thanks very much. I'll hop back in the queue.
Operator
Thank you. Next question is from Kevin Ciabattoni of KeyBanc Capital. Your line is open.
Kevin Ciabattoni
Hi, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Nice quarter. You mentioned the parts trading business down year-over-year but up sequentially. I mean, are you better positioned now, you think, in terms of your inventory? I know, I think last quarter it sounded like maybe there was some mismatch there. Maybe, David, if you could just give us an update.
David Storch
I think our inventory is in good position. We were a little bit surprised Q1 in terms of the softness. I believe our inventory has probably ballooned a little bit Q1 and I think they are probably more in line with the results coming out of Q2. So we have a great position in this market, not just here in the United States, but worldwide and we had nice improvement, Q2 over Q1, notwithstanding the fact that on a year-over-year basis, we were down. So great team in place, and again, I believe that that market â our performance will be fine. 
Kevin Ciabattoni
Okay. Can you give us an update on what â where you are in terms of airlift positions to finish the quarter, and maybe also kind of what the bid pipeline's looking like there currently? I know it sounds like there are some delays in terms of awards, but just in terms of what you're seeing on RFPs, et cetera.
David Storch
Let me turn it over to Tim Romenesko.
Tim Romenesko
Yeah, so we ended the quarter with 22 positions, but then on December 1, three positions â three contract positions were completed. Those we expect to be put out for rebid here in the next few months and we got a chance at least to get those back. There are a few other larger RFPs that we think are going to be coming, we heard are going to be coming, but we havenât seen them yet, and these are the RFPs that we have been talking for a few quarters here. So as David mentioned in this comments, they have been slow to hit the market and itâs impacted our results and our outlook. 
Kevin Ciabattoni
So, with those three positions rolling off ahead of the Falklands coming back â coming on in 4Q, I mean, is it likely that we'll see negative gross margins out of expeditionary in the third quarter?

Tim Romenesko
Weâre looking â the third quarter we're expecting to be lighter than the second quarter due to the three positions coming out as well as the increase in cost that David referred to related to the startup of the Falklands program, so yes.
Kevin Ciabattoni
Okay. And last one, Iâll jump back in queue. Any update you can give on where things stand with the DynCorp legal matter and then also related to that, I guess where the recompete stands for that program? We've also heard that theyâre considering splitting that contract up into multiple silos, does that impact your revenue opportunity there on the recompete?
David Storch
Well, they already split a year ago from the traditional INL contract. So that's pretty well known -- that's generally well-known. In terms of our expectation for the current bid, let's say, we're not aware of any â there has been no indication of a desire to split that. So we think we have a good competitive solution set and we maintain, weâve submitted our proposal and weâre waiting to hear.
Kevin Ciabattoni
Have you got any update on timing there as to when they expect to award that?
David Storch
I think weâre led to believe somewhere in the January-February timeframe.
Kevin Ciabattoni
Okay. And nothing on the legal matter that you can?
David Storch
No. I mean I think so far, all decisions have been -- are public in nature and have been favorable towards us.
Kevin Ciabattoni
Okay. Thanks guys.
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Next question is from Stan Mann of Mann Family Investments. Your line is open.
Stan Mann
Yes. Good afternoon. I have three questions. One on cash utilization, David, you mentioned acquisitions, you mentioned buybacks, is there anything you can, any color that you can give us on your sense are acquisitions near, far, are they -- are you looking at accretive, a little color on cash utilization?
David Storch
The only confidence I have is accretive. So anything that happens will be accretive. In terms of near or far, it will be relatively out of our control. We are actively engaged on a few situations, but it's hard to say whether decisions are imminent or not. So we will continue to look at all the different possibilities. Obviously, the balance sheet is in very strong position and with some of the uncertainty in the world, we view that as a pretty good position to be in.
Stan Mann
Okay. And the buybacks, of course, you have $91 million, which could be a significant reduction in shares outstanding? There seem to be worse that are occurring or battles, including the Saudis and Yemen with Air Force and troops. And now I guess the Great Britain and US are sending operations teams to Helmand Province in Afghanistan. Will any of those events have a near term effect on our business?
David Storch
I'm not sure. I can't say I have an answer to that. I think if pace picks up, so there is more action, then it will have a favorable impact on our business, but I can't comment because I just don't know if moving people into Helmand province or other things you referenced will have an impact on our -- meaningful impact on our business.
Stan Mann
Okay. The reason I asked about the Saudis is you said that you had a Saudi air repair contract that you jointly administer?
David Storch
Right. So yeah, I'm not aware of any direct impact. Our relationship with the UAE, they are also actively engaged in the Yemen market, should be favorable to, but I can't think of anything short term.
Stan Mann
Are you seeing additional solicitations or interests?
David Storch
Weâre seeing lots of interest and we are seeing solicitations. I don't believe the necessary related to those items, Stan, I think theyâre related to the needs in a general sense.
Stan Mann
Okay. Itâs positive though potentially?

David Storch
I don't think how it can get any more negative.
Stan Mann
Okay. Thanks. Good job, gentlemen.
David Storch
Thank you.

Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the AAR's Fiscal 2016 Third Quarter Earnings Call. We are joined today by David Storch, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Mike Sharp, Chief Financial Officer; Tim Romenesko, Vice Chairman and Chief Operating Officer of Expeditionary Services; and John Holmes, Chief Operating Officer of Aviation Services.
Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that comments made during the call may include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 as noted in our news release and the Risk Factors section of the company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2015. In providing forward-looking statements, the company assumes no obligation to provide updates to reflect future circumstances or anticipated or unanticipated events.
At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to AAR's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, David Storch.
David Storch
Thank you. Thank you very much and good afternoon to all and thank you for joining us today to discuss our fiscal year third quarter results. Overall, the businesses delivered good results in what is historically our shortest quarter due to the holidays we have in December and, of course, February, although this year we picked up one day so a shorter month than other months. I'll share some highlights on our business performance and I'll turn it over to Mike to provide more details on the financials.
Our Aviation Service business, we saw sales increase all organically of 9.7% and $30.8 million compared to the prior year. Distribution programs continued to deliver strong results driven by the ramp of recent contracts. We had a few key wins as well. Subsequent to the quarter-end, we were awarded a five-year, $105 million, firm fixed price contract by NAVAIR, for the procurement of contractor logistics support including commercial depot support and site support to the C-40A aircraft. We expect that work to commence approximately in 60 days and we're very excited about this winning this contract.
The C-40A is a 737 derivative. It's an aircraft we have lots of experience with and, as I indicated, we're pretty excited to have won this contract. We are pleased and honored that our government customers routinely turn to AAR for comprehensive solutions that rely our broad capability set, deep expertise, and scale. We believe we bring valuable commercial off the shelf programs to the government customer.
During the quarter we signed a power-by-the-hour contract with IBEX Airlines of Japan to support its fleet of CRJs. This win expands our presence in Asia and leverages the CRJ experience we currently have in North America supporting Mesa and Jazz. And on top of these wins, the pipeline for new business opportunities is strong and hopefully, in Q4, we'll be able to complete some of the transactions that are currently being negotiated.
Our MRO operations experienced double-digit growth, capacity utilization. Our hangar network continues to be strong. We also saw higher volumes in our landing gear repair, component repair and engineering business lines.
Moving over to Expeditionary Services, we saw sales decline of 8.1 million from the prior-year quarter. Mobility sales were down. Demand continues to be challenged there. But, as you know, we continue to be an industry leader with strong product offering and, if you look back in time, you'll note that from time to time that business does experience soft periods and then followed typically by periods of great strength.

We remain optimistic with what the future holds for that business, even though today we're in a soft period. We recently announced a five-year, $49 million contract with the U.S. Army for the next generation automatic test shelters, an extension of contracts we've had in the past and we're very excited to have won that contract.
Airlift revenue was up year-over-year. As we've talked about in the past, we commence operations on the Falkland contract. That begins April 1. We're operating two brand new AW189 helicopters. We've been spending the last few months in training, in preparation. Thereâs been a cost, if you will, that has been associated with those contracts against - costs associated with that contract running against our numbers in Qs 2 and 3 and, in Q4, that program turned positive. The aircraft are on site and all the necessary training and approvals are on schedule, so we're very excited. This will be our first search and rescue contract that we've had and we're pretty pleased with that as well.
In addition, we formally launched our Rotorcraft Services business, which offers a suite of aftermarket sport services from across AAR and is rooted in our experience as an operator of the helicopters in our airlift operation. There's pressure, there's pricing pressure coming out of the DOD on our airlift business. We expect that to continue as demand has compressed, but once again, we think in time the demand for that product, that service will improve and increase as well.
So overall, when you look at our operations, you look at our businesses, we feel very good about where we stand today. We feel good about the results that we experienced in Q3 and we come into Q4 with a fair amount of momentum.
So with that, I'll turn the call over to Mike.
Michael Sharp
Thanks, David. I will discuss our third quarter financial performance in more detail and start by saying that sales for the quarter were $402.8 million, up 6% over prior year. As David mentioned, Aviation Services sales increased $30.8 million or 9.7% higher over the prior year, while our Expeditionary Services segment reported a 13.1% decline in sales.
Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $0.31 and included a $1.6 million, or $0.05 per diluted share reduction in income taxes recorded in the third quarter, primarily associated with truing up certain deferred taxes.
The gross profit margin in Aviation Services was 16.8% this quarter compared with 15.9% last year. The increase in the gross profit margin was driven by improvement in certain of our supply chain programs, as well as within our MRO network, which benefited from higher sales. In the Expeditionary Services segment, the gross profit margin was slightly negative and reflects the decline in top line in the segment.
SG&A expenses in the period were 10.6% of sales compared to 11% last year. As I mentioned in our call back in December, overall, we feel good about our cost structure and the opportunity for improvement in this ratio will largely come from increasing sales.
Net interest expense was $1.6 million in the period compared with 6.4 million last year and reflects the significant decline in outstanding borrowings. Our effective tax rate for the period was 24.1% and, again, was lower due to the $1.6 million benefit. Going forward, we expect our effective income tax rate to approximate 35% to 36%.
Turning to cash, we generated $2 million of cash from operations this quarter, which reflects investments of nearly $15 million of inventory to support our supply chain activities. CapEx for the quarter was $43.6 million. This amount is unusually high and includes the purchase of one AW189 rotary wing aircraft that was also sold and leased back in the period. This particular helicopter will support the Falkland Islands contract. We also had other one-time investments in the quarter. Again, this CapEx was unusually high and we expect CapEx will return to a more normal level in Q4 in the $7 million to $10 million range.

Depreciation and amortization including amortization of stock-based compensation was $14.3 million. During the period, we paid $2.6 million of dividends and repurchased approximately 312,000 shares in the open market for $7.3 million. As of February 29, $84.1 million remains under the board authorized plan. As a result of the higher than normal CapEx, other investments in the business, and share buybacks, our net debt increased $145.3 million at the end of the period. However, our net debt to capital ratio remains a very low 14%.
Subsequent to the quarter end, we retired the remaining $25.7 million of our convertible notes. The annual book interest savings associated with the retirement is approximately $1.4 million and we will see one quarter's worth of this savings in the fourth quarter.
Thanks for your attention and I will now turn the call back over to David.
David Storch
Hey, thanks, Mike, and thank you, everyone for joining today's call.
In summary, it was a good quarter for the company. Aviation Services maintained very strong organic growth. We feel really good about that. We also feel good about our balance sheet position, and continue to evaluate opportunities to deploy capital to our shareholders' benefit.
With that, I would like to turn the call back to the operator for any questions you may have.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you, sir. [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Larry Solow of CJS Securities. Your line is open.
Larry Solow
Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. David, in Aviation Services, another quality quarter about 10% growth on consecutive quarters. It seems to be driven by a good mixture across your businesses. Anything, trends during the quarter, you sound pretty optimistic. I mean, I know you had, at one point, thought this could be a - can maintain a sustainable high single-digit or even low double-digit top line growth. How do you feel about the business in general, and then specifically in the parts business, any commentary on that would be great. Thanks.
David Storch
So, Larry, I feel good about the business. I feel we're in a good position. The demand seems to be pretty robust. I feel good about our positioning. We're doing good work out of our shop so the heavy maintenance business has been relatively strong. The supply businesses in total have been strong. We had the trading business was a little soft in the quarter, but better than the quarter before. And we're entering the fourth quarter with good momentum across all the businesses. So we feel good about the prospects for our Aviation Services businesses.
Larry Solow
And this may be hard to measure or quantify, but maybe anecdotally with oil, although it's come back up a little bit, still I think the going belief is it'll remain well below it for the next at least near future, are you seeing some of these older planes stay on longer and with that, I guess, you would be a net beneficiary of that?
David Storch
I can't say that we're seeing anything unusual in that regard. So I believe that there is a mixture as new aircraft are coming into the system. I believe a percentage of those aircraft are for growth and a percentage are to replace some of the older aircraft. But at the end of the day, our business benefits from just having more aircraft in the system. So if you look at the Navy aircraft we'll be supporting, those are 737-700s, relatively modern aircraft, and if you look at the mix of most of our customers today, you'll see that there's a good blend of newer aircraft and older aircraft.
So I think as we move forward, I'm not sure if the price of fuel is playing a huge factor in this equation other than the airlines continue to do very well in this environment, and maintaining their schedules is important to them. So paying for the spare parts and the maintenance to be performed on a timely basis, I believe, is working in our favor. So there have been years past where airlines have deferred maintenance or they deferred inventory spend. I can't say that we're seeing that today.

Larry Solow
Okay. And on the Expeditionary Services, mobility has that taken another it looks like another leg down or is that fairly some further drop from year-over-year?
David Storch
Yeah. The mobility business has continued to surprise us to the negative. That being said, we did have a nice win on this one contract in the quarter. And I believe that business will be tough here, continue to be tough for the near term. At some point, the supplies are going to start diminishing the level of safety spares that the government maintains. And at that point, I would expect to see a pick-up in that business.
So if you look at that business from a 30-year horizon standpoint, going back, you will have noted these kinds of times where there was a downward pressure. So this will be similar to what we experienced in 1998, 1999, 2000, but again, we feel good about our leadership position in this field. We know that the product is necessary. It's just not being ordered today but it will be ordered and we'll be in a good position to deal with it. We're taking good actions around the cost side, so we're improving our competitiveness on a going-forward basis. And yeah, I think we're taking the right actions.
Larry Solow
Great. Just lastly, you guys had planned an Analyst's Day for April. Is that still in the works?
David Storch
Yeah, no, the April date, as it turned out, we had conflict in a few different things. I think now we're going back to October which is the timeframe we've historically held our Analyst's Days. We tried to see if we could do it in July, but we ran into conflicts there with June's quarter earnings results. I think that was the same problem in April, too, as I think about it. So the October period is, I think - we'll run into some September quarter pressure but we're going to hold it a little earlier in October. So that's what we're shooting for.
Larry Solow
Got you. Great, thanks.
David Storch
Yeah.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Spingarn of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Robert Spingarn
Hi there.
David Storch
Hi, Rob.
Michael Sharp
Hey, Rob.
Robert Spingarn
So just sticking with Expeditionary. David, how do we think about - well, first maybe talk about the number of aircraft employed and what you expectations are, but then also some of the disappointment. It sounds like it's gotten a little incrementally worse than you would have expected and there's some pricing pressure. So how do we think about the number of aircraft going forward based on what you can see and then on the potential margins in this business, if this pricing pressure's going to stick around?
David Storch
So let me turn it over to Tim to address the number of aircraft and an overall snapshot as to how we see things today.
Timothy Romenesko
Yeah, so Rob, we are - we ended the quarter with the same 19 that we had on the first day of the quarter. Then we'll add three contract positions with the Falkland Islands contract. Its four aircraft but its three contract positions. The 189s are two aircraft to make one because of the location.
We'll have to see. We've got contract positions that are up, that have been rebid and we'll see if we're able to retain them. The pricing pressure is extremely difficult, and we're really not inclined to tie up our assets for long periods of time at this kind of pricing level. So we're being disciplined on our pricing and kind of taking a longer view. So we'll see. At the same time, we're also looking for the non-DoD kind of battlefield support, more search and rescue opportunities like the Falkland Islands to diversify our business.
Robert Spingarn
Is the pricing pressure demand driven or supply driven? Or is it both?
Timothy Romenesko
Well, there's excess capacity, right? There are players - if you know the helicopter market, you know that there's not very much good going on, right? The oil and gas aircraft are significantly under-utilized. The DoD aircraft are significantly under-utilized. Some of the firefighting are under-utilized. So there is plenty of assets out there. So, I guess itâs fewer requirements from our core customer combined with a glut of equipment available.

Robert Spingarn
Okay. So with that in mind, David, we've talked in the past. We've framed this business as being potentially an equivalent contributor to the other business. You know, when we do the math, if we back out the tax help, I think you earned about $0.26 in the quarter and maybe only $0.01 of that was dilution from expeditionary's loss, small loss. But to get up to where you've been in the past, for Expeditionary to contribute a like or a similar quantity of earnings, in cents per share, it sounds like a huge amount has to happen.
David Storch
Well, there's one contract in particular that happens will get us very close to that. So, I think we're defining the business in a broader sense, so we have a large contract that's been - we haven't talked about necessarily but it's been talked about that we're competing on that, if that were to come our way, that would go a long way to achieving what you just mentioned.
Robert Spingarn
Is that contract simply binary? You win it or you lose it or could you share it?
David Storch
Yes. No. Win or lose. It's binary.
Robert Spingarn
Okay. All right, thank you very much.
David Storch
Yeah.
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Kevin Ciabattoni of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Kevin Ciabattoni
Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions.
David Storch
Sure, Kevin.
Kevin Ciabattoni
Congratulations on that C-40A contract. That's a nice win for you guys. I'm wondering if you can give us any color around the revenue cadence for the contract. It looks like the initial order was I think $2 million or $3 million, so obviously pretty small relative to the overall size of the contract, so, just kind of curious how you see that playing out over the next four to five years.
David Storch
Yeah, we believe the revenues will be more or less equal throughout the period. Now there will be other aspects which will contribute based on over and above, and things of that nature. But in essence, think of it as evenly distributed over the five-year period.
Kevin Ciabattoni
Okay. That's helpful. Any update, David, on the INL contract in terms of timing? I know last quarter you thought January, February, it seems like they're dragging their feet with that a little bit. I know there was a letter put out earlier this month, kind of calling on them to award that by the end of June/July timeframe. How are you guys seeing that today?
David Storch
Yeah, Kevin, it's out of our control. So it's in the hands of the government and we have reason to believe that they're inclined to make a decision in the next 30 to 45 days.
Kevin Ciabattoni
Have you gotten any insight into what's taking them so long to award that?
David Storch
No.
Kevin Ciabattoni
Okay. And then last one from me, on the Rotorcraft Services business, can you talk a little bit about maybe the markets you're primarily going after there and kind of what you see there in terms of a demand pipeline?
David Storch
Yeah. So we're basically saying, for the last 60 years, we've been heavily involved in the fixed wing business, supporting fixed wing operators. We really entered the helicopter market with the acquisition of the airlift business back in 2010. We've been pretty busy flying airplanes. We always thought all along that we would - part of our strategy was to move into support for these asset types, and now we have the time, if you will, and resources to go ahead and do so. So we'll be approaching a broad-based market. We'll be looking to be in the supply and the repair ends of this market. And we'll pick our spots, we'll shoot for higher margin opportunities and hopefully you'll start seeing some results coming out of this in the near term.
Kevin Ciabattoni
As a follow on to that, given the state of the rotorcraft market right now, I mean, you touched on it earlier, I guess I'd look and say, why now? What do you see is the advantage to getting into that market now just given the road bumps they're seeing there?

David Storch
Yeah, I actually think there's so much dislocation in that market right now that it's an opportunity for somebody to come in with a clean balance sheet and a clean set - a new set of eyes to look at that market opportunistically, and that's how we're approaching it.
Kevin Ciabattoni
Okay. Thanks.
David Storch
Yeah.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from [ph] Stan Mann of Mann Family Investors. Your line is open.
Unidentified Analyst
Good afternoon. Good overall job. I have three questions, David.
David Storch
Okay.
Unidentified Analyst
One is, are there opportunities near-term for adding onto our Aviation Services and MRO business realistically?
David Storch
Adding on?
Unidentified Analyst
Yeah.
David Storch
So, think of the growth in two perspectives. If you look at the growth that you've seen here the last year or so, it's all been organically generated. And we have a very healthy pipeline, [ph] Stan, of opportunities. You'll see in the quarter we've made some investments in inventory to support some different activities that we have going on in that regard.
So we're still a relatively small player in a very big pond. So I think there's a fair amount - we have an ambitious leadership team. They're covering a lot of bases today and they see lots of markets that are still available for us to participate in. So I think look for organic growth in that give-or-take 10% range.
And you'll note that there's very few people in this industry growing at that rate organically. And matter of fact, you'd have a hard time pointing out any, at least, that are in the public domain that are growing at that rate organically. So we feel good about the organic growth prospects and the balance sheet is strong. I've indicated in the release today that we will look for acquisitions that make sense, and in that particular market, we're looking at a few different things. So I think our focus is on organic growth because it's fairly attractive, and secondly is look for acquisitions either bolt-on in nature or larger-scale in nature. And we have our eyes open for both.
Unidentified Analyst
Do you see anything near-term, specifically in bolt-on, in the area that we are where we're strong and growing? I have a reason for the logic that I'm trying to...
David Storch
I'd like to hear your reason before I respond.
Unidentified Analyst
Well my rationale is I'm wondering, don't fall off your chair, if it isn't time to possibly sell off or move out of this Expeditionary primarily government market, like the Telair spinoff, but create a core that grows consistently and doesn't depend on government bids. It would be seem to me that we could increase our company valuation dramatically by making a step out of an erratic business or a non-predictable. That' just...
David Storch
Yeah. So, [ph] Stan, if we were having this conversation five years ago, you would have said why don't you sell off your commercial business because you're doing so well in the defense market that why would you go ahead and minimize the progress you're making in that market by being in the commercial market? So I think if you look back in time and you've been a shareholder for a period of time, you'll note that we've had, by having this balance, we've been able to perform quite well through good times and bad times.
Now we're at an extreme point in time in that the Expeditionary businesses are at their low point, their absolute low point in the cycle. And our view is that this wouldn't be a good time to do what you just indicated because this isn't - we wouldn't be maximizing value. So we have long memories and even short memories, and these businesses are at leadership positions in their markets. It doesn't mean that we're married to these forever. Clearly, we're not.

But at the same token, I think that the strategy of maintaining this two-prong capability is the right strategy at this moment. It doesn't mean that we're not going to explore different possibilities. And we have, as you know, we have a very dynamic board group. And once a year, we do in-depth strategic reviews at every quarterly board meeting. We have discussion about the company's strategy. So we'll continue to look at what's best for our shareholders.
Unidentified Analyst
Okay. So last part is it seems to me we have a large potential stock buyback. I feel our stock is a bargain. I mean, so we have $80 million-something open, I believe, to buy in the buyback.
David Storch
That's correct, $81 million.
Unidentified Analyst
So at this point do you think that that could be a best investment option for us that we don't have M&A closed in, et cetera?
David Storch
Well, we invested $35 million or $40 million this quarter in ways that we think are going to grow the business. We also invested $7 million or so in share repurchases. I mean, my preference is to grow the business and to use our capital base to grow the business. But from time-to-time, when we deem it appropriate, we will look to opportunistically purchase the shares. But we're not looking at purchasing the shares as a strategy to growth. We're looking at the purchasing of shares as a way to balance out our performance and the use of our capital.
Right now, we're seeing some very interesting growth opportunities for the company, and we have in the period of time that we've been a net investor in the businesses and the way I'm seeing things today, I see us continuing to invest in the business as a priority to buying in the shares. It doesn't mean we're not going to buy any shares. It's just that my preference right now is to support the growth of the company and we're seeing some pretty attractive opportunities in this regard.
Unidentified Analyst
Well, I do trust your judgment. I just suggest that maybe we sometimes have too much patience.
David Storch
Got it.
Unidentified Analyst
But I'm a long-time holder...
David Storch
Got it.
Unidentified Analyst
And I see good things in areas that are not being recognized. That's the only reason for my comment.
David Storch
Got it.
Unidentified Analyst
But good job, good quarter and thank you.
David Storch
Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. As we have no further questions in queue, I'd like to turn the call over to David Storch for any closing remarks.

We are joined today by David Storch, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Michael Sharp, Chief Financial Officer; Tim Romenesko, Vice Chairman and Chief Operating Officer of Expeditionary Services; and John Holmes, Chief Operating Officer of Aviation Services.Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that comments made during the call may include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as noted in our news releases and the Risk Factors section of the company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2015. In providing forward-looking statements, the company assumes no obligation to provide updates to reflect future circumstances or anticipated or unanticipated events.At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to AAR's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, David Storch. Sir, please go ahead.David StorchThank you, maâam, and good afternoon, and thanks to those who are joining us today to discuss our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2016 results. Overall, we had a good quarter and our business has performed in line with our expectations. Today, I will share some highlights on the results and then turn the call over to Mike who will provide some detail on the financials, and then we will open up to questions.First off on our Aviation Services segment, we saw sales increase of 11.2% or 40.2 million, so really good organic growth. Our distribution programs sub businesses delivered strong results. Growth was primarily driven by the ramp up of a few distribution lines as well as new government contracts including C-130 over in Afghanistan and C-40A support contracts.During the quarter, we announced several key wins that will expand our global presence going forward. We signed an agreement with UTC Aerospace Systems to distribute products to an Asian defense customer. Thatâs a multiyear contract. Weâve already made the investments. The revenues, though, wonât start until later in the fiscal year.We won a contract with fastjet, a leading low cost carrier in Africa to provide power-by-the-hour component inventory management and repair services for their fleet of A319 aircraft. We also won a similar contract with Volotea, a Spanish low cost carrier also operating the A319 series aircraft.Finally, subsequent to quarter end, we announced that we were awarded a multiyear contract or a series of multiyear contracts to provide rotable component and wheel, tire and brake services for CommutAirâs ERJ 145 fleet that weâll be operating in support of United Airlines. This tip-to-tail support program simplifies the type of turnkey solutions weâre able to offer with our breadth of expertise and scale.Our trading businesses performed on a sequential basis and also when we compare it to the prior year. And our MRO operations experienced organic double-digit growth for the third consecutive quarter. This was principally driven by strong capacity utilization across our airplane and maintenance network where we sold over 1.4 million man hours in the quarter. We also saw higher volumes on our landing gear repair, component repair and engineering service business lines.Turning over to Expeditionary Services, we had a slight increase in sales, mostly driven by the launch of our Falkland Islands search and rescue program, which we kicked off in April. Our team did a great job setting up this operating and our execution has been flawless thus far.During the quarter we also secured a $21.7 million new contract win as well as an extension of an existing contract, each one covering operations in Afghanistan. But despite these positive developments, our airlift business continues to be challenged and weâre looking for ways to get better results from that business.Thank you for your attention. Iâll turn the call over to Mike.Michael SharpThanks, David. I will now discuss our fourth quarter financial performance in a bit more detail and start by saying that sales for the quarter were 458.2 million, up a strong 10.2% over the prior year. As David mentioned, Aviation Services sales increased 40.2 million or 11.2% year-over-year while Expeditionary Services segment sales reported a slight increase in sales.The gross profit margin in Aviation Services was 15.8%. As discussed in the past, margins in this segment will fluctuate based on mix of product and services sold and that is what we saw this period. In the Expeditionary Services segment, the gross profit margin was slightly positive at 1.9% and continues to reflect the softness in the markets we serve in this segment.SG&A expenses as a percent of sales were 10.1% and improved from 12.3% last year and 10.6% of sales in our third quarter. Again, overall, we feel good about our cost structure and the opportunity for improvement in this ratio will largely come from continuing to increase sales.Net interest expense was 1.1 million in the period compared to 7 million last year and reflects the significant decline in average outstanding borrowings compared with this time last year. Our effective income tax rate for the period was 34%.Turning to cash, we generated a strong $46 million of cash from operations in the fourth quarter. CapEx for the quarter was 14.2 million and depreciation and amortization, including the amortization of stock-based compensation, was 13.5 million.During the period we paid $2.6 million of dividends and repurchased approximately 61,000 shares in the open market for 1.4 million. As of May 31, a little under $83 million remains available under the Board authorized share repurchase plan.As a result of the strong cash flow from operations, net debt decreased $26 million from February 29 to end the year at $119 million. Our net debt to capital ratio remains a low 12%.During the fourth quarter, we retired the remaining 25.7 million of our convertible notes. The annual book interest savings associated with this retirement was approximately 1.4 million and we saw a full quarter's worth of savings in Q4.Thanks, and Iâll now turn the call back over to David.David StorchThanks, Mike. Overall, as I indicated earlier, fiscal year 2016 was a solid year for the company with strong organic sales growth in Aviation Services. We ended the year with an excellent financial position that gives us stability, flexibility and capacity to capitalize on market opportunities. We will continue to make investments in our industry-leading operations as we move into fiscal year '17, and I am excited about our future prospects.On that note, let me conclude my comments with our guidance for fiscal year '17. As stated in our earnings release, we currently expect sales in the range of 1.7 billion to 1.8 billion. We anticipate further growth in our Aviation Services segment and slight improvement in Expeditionary Services.Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the full year 2017 is expected to be in a range of $1.30 to $1.40, which at the midpoint represents an increase of 16.4% compared for the full year of fiscal year 2016. As you consider this guidance, note that we expect a feasibly low first quarter with results improving throughout the year.At the point, let me turn the call back to the operator for any questions you may have.Question-and-Answer SessionOperatorThank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Kevin Ciabattoni with KeyBanc. Your line is open. Please go ahead.Kevin CiabattoniHi. Good afternoon, guys.David StorchHi, Kevin.Kevin CiabattoniLooking at corporate expense and I guess particularly the SG&A line, I know when you divested Telair, you had talked about seeing a 20% reduction in corporate expense as a target. Just wondering, maybe Mike, if you can talk a little bit about kind of where you are against that target, and is there still room to bring corporate down and maybe how youâre thinking about SG&A for next year?Michael SharpSo we communicated that target reduction, Kevin, last year and that was all largely realized sometime in the first quarter of this fiscal year. I think largely weâve completed all those activities. There is always perhaps some room. But as I indicated, Kevin, weâre pretty comfortable with the cost structure not just at corporate but across the company not that we donât analyze and continue to focus on it. But that ratio that we tend to talk about as a percent of sales we think itâs mostly going to improve as we go forward from increasing sales.Kevin CiabattoniOkay. And then maybe on the â sticking to the margin theme and Expeditionary as we look at next year, margins have bounced around a little bit there over the past couple of years. Weâve seen a couple of quarters that were negative. How are we looking at Expeditionary margins for next year? Are you guys viewing that as being profitable through the whole year?David StorchYes, let me ask Tim to answer that question, Kevin.Timothy RomeneskoHi, Kevin. So weâre looking for improved margins off of fiscal 2016 base. You probably saw today that we were awarded a couple of new contract positions in Afghanistan for S-61 helicopters. We expect those to start contributing to our results late in this quarter and really have a full effect in the second quarter. So between that, the five-year program and some of the other things that weâre working on and we are expecting improved margins from fiscal '16 levels.Kevin CiabattoniOkay. And Tim, while I have you, in terms of active positions right now I think based on what you said last quarter, if you hadnât lost any, you should be at 22. Can you talk a little bit about where we are in airlift right now?Timothy RomeneskoYes, so weâre at 21 today. We picked up the two additional in Afghanistan and we ended the third quarter at 19.Kevin CiabattoniOkay, perfect. And then last one from me and Iâll jump back in queue. Can you talk about what youâve seen in the trading business over the past few months? I know it was getting a little bit tougher in terms of competition. Supply was tightening. Have you seen any shift in either direction in that business? And I know itâs a pretty high margin business for you guys historically. Is that creating any kind of margin headwinds on the Aviation Services side?David StorchSo Kevin, this is David once again. I donât believe that the pressures have been around competition as much as the pressures have been around overall market demand. So this quarter was a pretty decent quarter for that business, improvement sequentially and improvement year-on-year; correct and that the levels are not where we may have been historically and correct that weâve been fairly profitable in this business. So we remain cautiously optimistic that as we move along into the new fiscal year, these businesses will perform well and have a positive impact on year-over-year margin results.Kevin CiabattoniGreat. Thanks, guys.OperatorThank you. [Operator Instructions].David StorchThere may be a problem with people getting questions in, because I know there were a couple of people who expressed interest in getting questions but we donât see their names on your list.Operator[Operator Instructions]. I have a follow up from Kevin Ciabattoni with KeyBanc. Your line is open. Please go ahead.Kevin CiabattoniIâll jump back in since mineâs working. On that KC-10 contract I know you guys have lost out as a prime bidder. Is there any chance going forward that you could get pulled back in as a sub to L-3 on that or are you aware that theyâre planning on going that alone?David StorchI think weâre best off probably not commenting on that. We donât see that necessarily as a possibility but probably best not to comment.Kevin CiabattoniOkay. And then on the INL contract that you guys are bidding on, the Department of State put out an additional one year extension for the incumbent. Can you just talk a little bit about â obviously itâs frustrating for you guys Iâm sure. Can you talk a little bit about what that extension does or doesnât do in terms of allowing the Department of State to announce a winner for the full competition? Does that prevent them from doing that until that extensionâs up or could they do that at any point in the interim?David StorchWeâre not aware of any impact on their decision-making process. Weâre aware of the extension. But again I think probably best off not to comment.Kevin CiabattoniOkay. Thanks, David.David StorchYes.OperatorThank you. [Operator Instructions]. Iâm showing no further questions at this time. Iâm sorry, Mr. Greg Dean with Worden Capital, your line is open. Please go ahead.Gregory DeanHowâs it going guys?David StorchGood.Gregory DeanGood. This might be a foolish question but I just decided to ask. With current cabinet in office, are there any expectations or concerns with change in cabinet potentially going democrat to republican in the next handful of months?David StorchNo difference on our business.Gregory DeanOkay. Thank you.David StorchWe want the best people to serve.Gregory DeanGot you. Thank you.OperatorThank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from the line of Tom Lewis with High Road Value [ph]. Your line is open. Please go ahead.Unidentified AnalystHi. Thanks. Just one and maybe this came up on the last conference call but can you give us any kind of update as far as winding down the manufacturing operations that you discontinued a year or so ago? Are they still on board or are we still in a disposition there?David StorchObviously, weâve sold the cargo business. That was a very successful transaction. We have successfully wound down the metals business and the composites business is still in our discontinued portfolio.Unidentified AnalystOkay, thatâs it. Thanks.David StorchThanks, Tom.OperatorThank you. Iâm showing no further questions at this time. Iâd like to turn the conference back over to management. Iâm sorry, I am now seeing one other question from the line of Bill Jacobs with Jacobs Investment. Your line is open. Please go ahead.Bill JacobsThanks. Iâm just looking at â it looks like the implied margins for fiscal '17 are something like 4.5% as you look at it on an EBIT basis and I think the market was looking for something closer to 6%. What do you see long term where you can get margins overall? Are we â I guess a lot of it depends on what happens with Expeditionary, but I guess what the marketâs disappointed about is that we are expecting the margin improvement and donât seem to be getting much.David StorchWeâre getting margin improvement in our core Aviation Service businesses and weâve expressed certain disappointments around airlift. We also are waiting on certain contracts and weâd be disappointed if our margins donât get closer to the area you indicated.Bill JacobsSo you think on a longer-term basis â maybe not in longer term, more intermediate term looking out two or three years, we can get sort of a 6%, 7% EBIT margins?David StorchI think better than that.Bill JacobsBetter than that?David StorchYes.Bill JacobsOkay. And then on Expeditionary, how long do you give it? At what point do you say, this is what the new world looks like and the money that we made in Afghanistan for those years has gone and itâs never going to be the business that it was. That was the aberration, not the current period and how long do you give it before you have to make a decision about whether this business fits â and the Aviation Services business is doing so well, how long do you give the other side of the shop?David StorchFirst off, think of it as two different businesses. One business more tied to say recent activities in Afghanistan, one business thatâs tied to true preparation, troop movements, et cetera, all over the world for the United States government. So the lineation would be â the distinction would be between our mobility business and our airlift business. In terms of â and if you look, the mobility business has been part of AAR since 1981 and has had in the past times of good performance and weaker performance based on the particular cycle surrounding those types of product and services. If you look at the airlift business, itâs a recent business to the company. To your point, it did very well in the Afghanistan build up. Weâre looking closely at that business for ways to extract value and we will do the best we can. And if we get to the point where we can no longer extract the right value, we will take other actions.Bill JacobsOkay. Is a sale possible or do you think â I know thatâs not what youâre looking at right now but if you think about that business and you say, okay, this isnât working. Is there a logical buyer for these assets?David StorchI donât think that Iâd look at it necessarily that way as much as â so we have some very meaningful contracts today. I think you heard earlier in the call we have 21 aircraft that weâre operating. Part of the challenge is the aircraft we have that are not operating. Some of the aircraft we do have up for sale and we do have interested parties in buying those assets. So it may very well be that the asset base gets compressed and also we take advantage of our knowledge, if you will, in serving helicopters to expand our services beyond just operating these aircraft.Bill JacobsAll right, thank you.David StorchOkay, thank you.OperatorThank you. Iâm showing no further questions at this time.David StorchOkay. Thank you very much for your participation today.OperatorLadies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in todayâs conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",0.95933443,0.9926424223817203,0.9271355634050384,4.3971925,0.9832543722655157,0.3817445129794609

David Storch
Thank you, maâam, and good afternoon, and thanks to those who are joining us today to discuss our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2016 results. Overall, we had a good quarter and our business has performed in line with our expectations. Today, I will share some highlights on the results and then turn the call over to Mike who will provide some detail on the financials, and then we will open up to questions.
First off on our Aviation Services segment, we saw sales increase of 11.2% or 40.2 million, so really good organic growth. Our distribution programs sub businesses delivered strong results. Growth was primarily driven by the ramp up of a few distribution lines as well as new government contracts including C-130 over in Afghanistan and C-40A support contracts.
During the quarter, we announced several key wins that will expand our global presence going forward. We signed an agreement with UTC Aerospace Systems to distribute products to an Asian defense customer. Thatâs a multiyear contract. Weâve already made the investments. The revenues, though, wonât start until later in the fiscal year.
We won a contract with fastjet, a leading low cost carrier in Africa to provide power-by-the-hour component inventory management and repair services for their fleet of A319 aircraft. We also won a similar contract with Volotea, a Spanish low cost carrier also operating the A319 series aircraft.
Finally, subsequent to quarter end, we announced that we were awarded a multiyear contract or a series of multiyear contracts to provide rotable component and wheel, tire and brake services for CommutAirâs ERJ 145 fleet that weâll be operating in support of United Airlines. This tip-to-tail support program simplifies the type of turnkey solutions weâre able to offer with our breadth of expertise and scale.
Our trading businesses performed on a sequential basis and also when we compare it to the prior year. And our MRO operations experienced organic double-digit growth for the third consecutive quarter. This was principally driven by strong capacity utilization across our airplane and maintenance network where we sold over 1.4 million man hours in the quarter. We also saw higher volumes on our landing gear repair, component repair and engineering service business lines.
Turning over to Expeditionary Services, we had a slight increase in sales, mostly driven by the launch of our Falkland Islands search and rescue program, which we kicked off in April. Our team did a great job setting up this operating and our execution has been flawless thus far.

During the quarter we also secured a $21.7 million new contract win as well as an extension of an existing contract, each one covering operations in Afghanistan. But despite these positive developments, our airlift business continues to be challenged and weâre looking for ways to get better results from that business.
Thank you for your attention. Iâll turn the call over to Mike.
Michael Sharp
Thanks, David. I will now discuss our fourth quarter financial performance in a bit more detail and start by saying that sales for the quarter were 458.2 million, up a strong 10.2% over the prior year. As David mentioned, Aviation Services sales increased 40.2 million or 11.2% year-over-year while Expeditionary Services segment sales reported a slight increase in sales.
The gross profit margin in Aviation Services was 15.8%. As discussed in the past, margins in this segment will fluctuate based on mix of product and services sold and that is what we saw this period. In the Expeditionary Services segment, the gross profit margin was slightly positive at 1.9% and continues to reflect the softness in the markets we serve in this segment.
SG&A expenses as a percent of sales were 10.1% and improved from 12.3% last year and 10.6% of sales in our third quarter. Again, overall, we feel good about our cost structure and the opportunity for improvement in this ratio will largely come from continuing to increase sales.
Net interest expense was 1.1 million in the period compared to 7 million last year and reflects the significant decline in average outstanding borrowings compared with this time last year. Our effective income tax rate for the period was 34%.
Turning to cash, we generated a strong $46 million of cash from operations in the fourth quarter. CapEx for the quarter was 14.2 million and depreciation and amortization, including the amortization of stock-based compensation, was 13.5 million.
During the period we paid $2.6 million of dividends and repurchased approximately 61,000 shares in the open market for 1.4 million. As of May 31, a little under $83 million remains available under the Board authorized share repurchase plan.
As a result of the strong cash flow from operations, net debt decreased $26 million from February 29 to end the year at $119 million. Our net debt to capital ratio remains a low 12%.
During the fourth quarter, we retired the remaining 25.7 million of our convertible notes. The annual book interest savings associated with this retirement was approximately 1.4 million and we saw a full quarter's worth of savings in Q4.
Thanks, and Iâll now turn the call back over to David.
David Storch
Thanks, Mike. Overall, as I indicated earlier, fiscal year 2016 was a solid year for the company with strong organic sales growth in Aviation Services. We ended the year with an excellent financial position that gives us stability, flexibility and capacity to capitalize on market opportunities. We will continue to make investments in our industry-leading operations as we move into fiscal year '17, and I am excited about our future prospects.
On that note, let me conclude my comments with our guidance for fiscal year '17. As stated in our earnings release, we currently expect sales in the range of 1.7 billion to 1.8 billion. We anticipate further growth in our Aviation Services segment and slight improvement in Expeditionary Services.
Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the full year 2017 is expected to be in a range of $1.30 to $1.40, which at the midpoint represents an increase of 16.4% compared for the full year of fiscal year 2016. As you consider this guidance, note that we expect a feasibly low first quarter with results improving throughout the year.
At the point, let me turn the call back to the operator for any questions you may have.

Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Kevin Ciabattoni with KeyBanc. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Kevin Ciabattoni
Hi. Good afternoon, guys.
David Storch
Hi, Kevin.
Kevin Ciabattoni
Looking at corporate expense and I guess particularly the SG&A line, I know when you divested Telair, you had talked about seeing a 20% reduction in corporate expense as a target. Just wondering, maybe Mike, if you can talk a little bit about kind of where you are against that target, and is there still room to bring corporate down and maybe how youâre thinking about SG&A for next year?
Michael Sharp
So we communicated that target reduction, Kevin, last year and that was all largely realized sometime in the first quarter of this fiscal year. I think largely weâve completed all those activities. There is always perhaps some room. But as I indicated, Kevin, weâre pretty comfortable with the cost structure not just at corporate but across the company not that we donât analyze and continue to focus on it. But that ratio that we tend to talk about as a percent of sales we think itâs mostly going to improve as we go forward from increasing sales.
Kevin Ciabattoni
Okay. And then maybe on the â sticking to the margin theme and Expeditionary as we look at next year, margins have bounced around a little bit there over the past couple of years. Weâve seen a couple of quarters that were negative. How are we looking at Expeditionary margins for next year? Are you guys viewing that as being profitable through the whole year?
David Storch
Yes, let me ask Tim to answer that question, Kevin.
Timothy Romenesko
Hi, Kevin. So weâre looking for improved margins off of fiscal 2016 base. You probably saw today that we were awarded a couple of new contract positions in Afghanistan for S-61 helicopters. We expect those to start contributing to our results late in this quarter and really have a full effect in the second quarter. So between that, the five-year program and some of the other things that weâre working on and we are expecting improved margins from fiscal '16 levels.
Kevin Ciabattoni
Okay. And Tim, while I have you, in terms of active positions right now I think based on what you said last quarter, if you hadnât lost any, you should be at 22. Can you talk a little bit about where we are in airlift right now?
Timothy Romenesko
Yes, so weâre at 21 today. We picked up the two additional in Afghanistan and we ended the third quarter at 19.
Kevin Ciabattoni
Okay, perfect. And then last one from me and Iâll jump back in queue. Can you talk about what youâve seen in the trading business over the past few months? I know it was getting a little bit tougher in terms of competition. Supply was tightening. Have you seen any shift in either direction in that business? And I know itâs a pretty high margin business for you guys historically. Is that creating any kind of margin headwinds on the Aviation Services side?
David Storch
So Kevin, this is David once again. I donât believe that the pressures have been around competition as much as the pressures have been around overall market demand. So this quarter was a pretty decent quarter for that business, improvement sequentially and improvement year-on-year; correct and that the levels are not where we may have been historically and correct that weâve been fairly profitable in this business. So we remain cautiously optimistic that as we move along into the new fiscal year, these businesses will perform well and have a positive impact on year-over-year margin results.
Kevin Ciabattoni
Great. Thanks, guys.
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions].
David Storch
There may be a problem with people getting questions in, because I know there were a couple of people who expressed interest in getting questions but we donât see their names on your list.

Operator
[Operator Instructions]. I have a follow up from Kevin Ciabattoni with KeyBanc. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Kevin Ciabattoni
Iâll jump back in since mineâs working. On that KC-10 contract I know you guys have lost out as a prime bidder. Is there any chance going forward that you could get pulled back in as a sub to L-3 on that or are you aware that theyâre planning on going that alone?
David Storch
I think weâre best off probably not commenting on that. We donât see that necessarily as a possibility but probably best not to comment.
Kevin Ciabattoni
Okay. And then on the INL contract that you guys are bidding on, the Department of State put out an additional one year extension for the incumbent. Can you just talk a little bit about â obviously itâs frustrating for you guys Iâm sure. Can you talk a little bit about what that extension does or doesnât do in terms of allowing the Department of State to announce a winner for the full competition? Does that prevent them from doing that until that extensionâs up or could they do that at any point in the interim?
David Storch
Weâre not aware of any impact on their decision-making process. Weâre aware of the extension. But again I think probably best off not to comment.
Kevin Ciabattoni
Okay. Thanks, David.
David Storch
Yes.
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Iâm showing no further questions at this time. Iâm sorry, Mr. Greg Dean with Worden Capital, your line is open. Please go ahead.
Gregory Dean
Howâs it going guys?
David Storch
Good.
Gregory Dean
Good. This might be a foolish question but I just decided to ask. With current cabinet in office, are there any expectations or concerns with change in cabinet potentially going democrat to republican in the next handful of months?
David Storch
No difference on our business.
Gregory Dean
Okay. Thank you.
David Storch
We want the best people to serve.
Gregory Dean
Got you. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from the line of Tom Lewis with High Road Value [ph]. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst
Hi. Thanks. Just one and maybe this came up on the last conference call but can you give us any kind of update as far as winding down the manufacturing operations that you discontinued a year or so ago? Are they still on board or are we still in a disposition there?
David Storch
Obviously, weâve sold the cargo business. That was a very successful transaction. We have successfully wound down the metals business and the composites business is still in our discontinued portfolio.
Unidentified Analyst
Okay, thatâs it. Thanks.
David Storch
Thanks, Tom.
Operator
Thank you. Iâm showing no further questions at this time. Iâd like to turn the conference back over to management. Iâm sorry, I am now seeing one other question from the line of Bill Jacobs with Jacobs Investment. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Bill Jacobs
Thanks. Iâm just looking at â it looks like the implied margins for fiscal '17 are something like 4.5% as you look at it on an EBIT basis and I think the market was looking for something closer to 6%. What do you see long term where you can get margins overall? Are we â I guess a lot of it depends on what happens with Expeditionary, but I guess what the marketâs disappointed about is that we are expecting the margin improvement and donât seem to be getting much.
David Storch
Weâre getting margin improvement in our core Aviation Service businesses and weâve expressed certain disappointments around airlift. We also are waiting on certain contracts and weâd be disappointed if our margins donât get closer to the area you indicated.
Bill Jacobs
So you think on a longer-term basis â maybe not in longer term, more intermediate term looking out two or three years, we can get sort of a 6%, 7% EBIT margins?

David Storch
I think better than that.
Bill Jacobs
Better than that?
David Storch
Yes.
Bill Jacobs
Okay. And then on Expeditionary, how long do you give it? At what point do you say, this is what the new world looks like and the money that we made in Afghanistan for those years has gone and itâs never going to be the business that it was. That was the aberration, not the current period and how long do you give it before you have to make a decision about whether this business fits â and the Aviation Services business is doing so well, how long do you give the other side of the shop?
David Storch
First off, think of it as two different businesses. One business more tied to say recent activities in Afghanistan, one business thatâs tied to true preparation, troop movements, et cetera, all over the world for the United States government. So the lineation would be â the distinction would be between our mobility business and our airlift business. In terms of â and if you look, the mobility business has been part of AAR since 1981 and has had in the past times of good performance and weaker performance based on the particular cycle surrounding those types of product and services. If you look at the airlift business, itâs a recent business to the company. To your point, it did very well in the Afghanistan build up. Weâre looking closely at that business for ways to extract value and we will do the best we can. And if we get to the point where we can no longer extract the right value, we will take other actions.
Bill Jacobs
Okay. Is a sale possible or do you think â I know thatâs not what youâre looking at right now but if you think about that business and you say, okay, this isnât working. Is there a logical buyer for these assets?
David Storch
I donât think that Iâd look at it necessarily that way as much as â so we have some very meaningful contracts today. I think you heard earlier in the call we have 21 aircraft that weâre operating. Part of the challenge is the aircraft we have that are not operating. Some of the aircraft we do have up for sale and we do have interested parties in buying those assets. So it may very well be that the asset base gets compressed and also we take advantage of our knowledge, if you will, in serving helicopters to expand our services beyond just operating these aircraft.
Bill Jacobs
All right, thank you.
David Storch
Okay, thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Iâm showing no further questions at this time.
David Storch
Okay. Thank you very much for your participation today.

We are joined today by David Storch, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Tim Romenesko, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer; and John Holmes, Chief Operating Officer of Aviation Services. Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that comments made during the call may include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 as noted in our news release and the Risk Factors section of the company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2016. In providing forward-looking statements, the company assumes no obligation to provide updates to reflect future circumstances or anticipated or unanticipated events. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to AAR's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, David Storch.David StorchGood afternoon and thank you for joining us today to discuss our fiscal year first quarter results. As you can see, overall, we had a very good quarter as diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 38% from $0.21 last year to $0.29 in the current period. During the first quarter, we ramped up recently awarded programs on our Aviation Services segment and we continue to win significant new business from both our commercial and government customers. And if I may, I'm just going to highlight a few examples of some of our wins in the period.We won contracts from both Enter Air and flydubai to provide power-by-the-hour component inventory management and repair services for more than 70 737 series aircraft. The latter agreement represents a significant expansion of AAR's commercial footprint in the Middle East and brings our total number of aircraft under management to over 1,200. We also signed an agreement with Asiana Airlines to provide landing gear repair services at our Miami Landing Gear facility. Further, we won a contract from CommutAir, which operates on behalf of the United Airlines as part of the United Express, to provide component repair and supply chain services for their fleet of 40 Embraer ERJ 145 aircraft.Our airlift business was awarded 2 additional rotary-wing positions in Afghanistan, and in addition the Military Sealift Command extended our 4 positions providing vertical replenishment services in the Indian Ocean and Western Pacific. These awards bring our total contract positions to 21 aircraft as of the end of the quarter. And of course, most significantly, our airlift business also was awarded the Global Aviation Support Services contract for the Department of State air wing, otherwise known as the INL/A program. Our airlift will be responsible for operating, maintaining and provisioning a current fleet of 140 airplanes and helicopters operating around the world. The potential duration of this contract is 11 years, including a 6-month phase-in. The incumbent contractor filed a protest on September 11, and we expect a decision on the protest no later than December 21.At this point, I want to thank you for your attention, and I'll turn the call over to Tim.Tim RomeneskoThanks, David. I'll discuss our first quarter financial performance in a bit more detail.As David indicated, we had a good first quarter. Sales in the quarter were $404.8 million, up 4.7% versus the prior year. Aviation Services sales increased $18.8 million, or 6% year-over-year, while Expeditionary Services segment reported a slight decrease in sales, although up from Q4.Gross profit increased year-over-year for both segments. The gross profit margin in Aviation Services was 16% with a mix of products and services responsible for the increase. In the Expeditionary Services' segment, the gross profit margin was 11.5, reflecting improved profitability in Mobility products.Our SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales were 11.1% for the first quarter, compared to 10.3% last year. The SG&A expense run rate is about in line with our expectations, and we expect that the SG&A as a percentage of sales will decline closer to our target of 10% as sales increased over the balance of the fiscal year.Now looking at interest expense for the quarter, it was $1.3 million compared to $1.9 million last year, and that's primarily as a result of the retirement of our remaining convertible notes during fiscal 2016. Our diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the first quarter was $0.29 compared to $0.21 in the prior year, and that's a 38% increase in EPS, as David had mentioned.Now taking a look at cash for a moment, we used $0.5 million of cash from operations for the quarter. In the prior year first quarter, we used $64.4 million. Our capital expenditures in the quarter were $9.4 million and depreciation and amortization was $14.9 million.During the period, during the quarter, we paid dividends of $2.6 million and we also repurchased approximately 619,000 shares of our stock in the open market for a price of $14.8 million. And that leaves us, as of August 31, with $67.9 million available under our Board-authorized share repurchase program.Our net debt decreased $7.1 million and we ended with $143.7 million of net debt. And our net debt-to-capital ratio is low at 14%. Our composites manufacturing business has continued to perform well, and as a result, we decided to retain it within our Expeditionary Services segment. And we've reclassified this into continuing operations for all the periods presented.So finally - so at this point, we are sticking to our guidance of $1.30 to $1.40. And we feel good about the quarter that just ended and we feel good about our outlook, but we're going to stick to our guidance at this point. So thanks for your interest. And I'll turn the call back over to David.David StorchThank you, Tim. So as you can see, first quarter 2017 was a nice improvement. We saw a nice improvement over the prior year. Our Aviation Services segment continued to exhibit strong growth, and our Expeditionary Services segment improved from recent performance levels. Once again, we ended the quarter in excellent financial position, giving us not just stability and flexibility, but also capacity to go ahead and look to take advantage of market opportunities as they present themselves. We will continue to make investments in our industry-leading operations as we move into fiscal year 2017, and I'm excited about our future prospects.At this time, I'll turn the call back over to the operator to open up the lines for any questions you may have.Question-and-Answer SessionOperator[Operator Instructions] And our first question or comment comes from the line of Larry Solow. Your line is now open.Larry SolowGreat thanks. Good afternoon. I was wondering if you could just maybe just on the Aviation Services side, it looks like supply chain is doing really well, big growth there, obviously adding more contracts and whatnot. Aftermarket, anything changing there? Anything in your - in the trading business? And then perhaps a better look just on the MRO side and what's going on there, would be great.David StorchWell, MRO had, as I think we signaled in the past, MRO's results this quarter are the softest historically for the year. And they didn't disappoint in that regard this year. It was soft again. To give you a sense of positions we had, on average, let's call it, in the middle of August, we had about 33 positions. When I say positions, I mean, aircraft and the hangars for maintenance. And now, we're running at 44 or mid-40s, I should - 40, 40-ish right now, September, and then we go up to 44 in November. So it will start ramping again as the year progresses. The supply chain business, as you say, Larry, is strong. We're seeing many opportunities. John Holmes is not with us here today in Chicago because he's out visiting with customers trying to drum up some additional business and actually meeting with a customer in our New York facility today. So yes, we're expecting, we're hopeful that we can announce a contract after October 1 that we were working out for quite some time. That's a pretty good size. And I would say around the horn, the supply chain businesses are strong. Aviation, the MRO has gone through its typical, cyclical experience and strengthening. And we're feeling pretty good about where we are today.Larry SolowOkay. So the MRO is more seasonality than anything else. And how about just Lake Charles? I know there's been some headwinds there. Can you maybe just giveâ¦?David StorchYes, we've been diminishing our footprint there. We're keeping it open for now for some light paint work type work. As we've discussed before, we - the State of Illinois has constructed a facility for us in Rockford that we're kind of pivoting towards. And hopefully, we'll be generating some revenue and income coming out of that facility in the not-too-distant future. We'll keep you up to speed on that.Larry SolowGot it. And just switching gears real quick on the Expeditionary side, it's I realize just sort of the, rather small numbers, and if you go back 3 years ago, gross profit was leagues higher, but a pretty nice improvement from the sort of low single digits to $8 million this quarter. And you said that was mostly on the Mobility side. I thought, I figured airlift also improved a little bit from the ramp in the Falkland Islands andâ¦David StorchYes. Yes, the airlift has improved a little bit...Larry SolowAnd how about mobility? What's sort of your thoughts there?David StorchWell, our thoughts are that we're seeing signs of life in both businesses. So we are seeing the inquiry level get stronger, and we're not overcommitting at this point. So, let's see what happens. I mean, as you know, the world environment is unsettled as ever and it's just a question of how much more action will - the U.S. will see outside in these different theaters, and that will be a good proxy for how our businesses do.Larry SolowOkay. And then just on the INL contract, I don't know what you can or can't say. Thoughts on potential margin being at least accretive to your current margins or maybe just on timing, assuming the ramping starts up in the early calendar 2017, would that first 6 months be dilutive? Or would that - how would that ramp sort of play out on a high level, David.David StorchWhy don't we hold off from making comments on the contract, it's in the protest period. And I think we'll talk about it once it emerges out of protest.Larry SolowThat sounds great. Thanks David, appreciate it.David StorchYeah, thank you.OperatorAlright. And our next question or comment comes from the line of Kevin Ciabattoni with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is now open.Kevin CiabattoniHi good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions guys, nice quarter. David StorchSure, thanks.Kevin CiabattoniOn the SG&A, obviously, it's a little bit high in the quarter, 11% of revenue. In the press release, you guys talked about some new business development efforts that drove that. Just wondering if there's any more color you can give on those whether there's specific areas or programs you can discuss.David StorchYes, so we've expanded our program selling capability, and I think what you're seeing here in some of these announcements is a reflection of their efforts. And we have a team of folks who joined us last year, and they're a wonderful team. They complement our organization in a very positive way. And we're very hopeful that we'll continue to benefit from their efforts. Also, first quarter is always a little softer for us because of MRO sales. But we anticipate - our goal is always to be below 10% and our goal is to get down to that level before the fiscal year is out.Kevin CiabattoniOkay. Thanks David. On the composites business, obviously bringing that back in under Mobility. Can you just remind us, was said that under Mobility previously, or was that within the Aviation business?David StorchYes. No, no, no, before, we had a manufacturing group of businesses, and it was - that's where it was. And when we sold off the businesses and we kind of restructured the manufacturing, we basically just stopped and looked to exit both the composites business and the metals business. We ultimately wound down the metals business, but the composite business, which we were trying to sell, we weren't able to get prices that we're happy with, so we thought it was best, from the customers' perspective, our people - for our people, et cetera, to go ahead and try to revitalize the business, which - and we've had some success in that regard. So, the business, based on how we see the markets unfolding, the leadership team at Mobility is a very capable leadership team, as you know. And they were eager to take on some added responsibility and they now have this operation as part of their business.Kevin CiabattoniCan you may be touch on what maybe specific end markets are seeing or are driving that revitalization that you mentioned? Are there specific markets you can point to where you're starting to see some traction there?David StorchWe've had success in the past and continue to have success serving some of the regional manufacturers. We've had some success on interiors for certain specialized aircraft. That business continues to be strong. So, I mean, we're looking at opportunities to support the Boeings of the world and the folks who support Boeing, as well some of the regional carriers that are out there as well. So, it's kind of like a niche-like business. We have some activity in the flat-panel world. And I don't know, Tim, is there anything else to add?Tim RomeneskoNo, that's pretty good. We're supporting some of the helicopter manufacturers. But that piece of the business has been doing pretty well.Kevin CiabattoniIs that - is it mostly commercial or mostly military or a good mix of the 2?Tim RomeneskoIt's both, but it's - both, but it's mostly commercial.Kevin CiabattoniOkay. And then last one for me. I know last quarter you guys mentioned that the engineering services business had a pretty nice quarter. I don't think you specifically called it out this quarter, but maybe just some color on what you're seeing there. I know - I think that tends to be a bit of a leading indicator for kind of the broader overhaul market, so maybe just some color on the engineering business.David StorchYes, I think the engineering business has had a couple of wins. We had one out of Africa, actually. The business is doing okay. It's got some opportunities that they're looking at. But at this point in time, it's not a needle mover either way.Operator[Operator Instructions] And our next question or comment comes from the line of Stan Mann with Mann Family Investors. Your line is now open.Stan MannCongratulations, a really good quarter.David StorchThanks Stan.Stan MannDavid, I have a question on priority use of cash as you generate. Would you say your emphasis is on buyback or acquisition? Or can you give us any color on what you think you'd utilize for in a priority basis?David StorchYes. The first priority is to use our capital to grow our business, strengthen our franchise and improve the depth of product that we offer to our customers. So that would be our prime - that would be our first priority. Short of being able to increase the business in that fashion, we - and let me make that into a part A and Part B. Part A of that is external deal, let's say acquisitions. Part B is funding existing capability. In the quarter just ended for instance, we spent a fair amount of money funding inventory programs for our strategic customers. Then, next, I'd say, share repurchase would be next. And of course, the Board, every quarter, reviews our dividend, our dividend policy, and that's always discussed as well.Stan MannCan you comment on whether you are close to or see viable deals, accretive deals, in what you're looking at now?David StorchWe're seeing deals that are interesting. We're not seeing anything that is compelling necessarily, but we are seeing stuff out there. There's a fair amount of stuff that we're looking at. As you know, we're being very selective and disciplined, but I would say the deal flow on the acquisition side is moderate, light to moderate in a general sense.Stan MannOkay. Last question is you've got - you've almost won the State Department contract for their fleet. So, if you look - let's assume we get that, do you see that as being accretive from a get-go? Or maybe you can't comment because of the challenge?David StorchYes, Stan, so first of all, we were awarded the contract. Stan MannYes.David StorchSo we have a contract. The contract is under a protest - under the protest. We're issued a stay order by the customer or a stop order. So, we are not working. We are no longer working on that contract, but we do have a contract. In terms of the profitability or impact on company's results, we prefer not to discuss that at this stage.Stan MannOkay. But it is a good contract for the company?David StorchWell, I prefer not to discuss it. I think it's a contract that - it's a program that we have a high level of confidence that - or well we know that we can deliver in a way that's superior to anything that the customer's accustomed to. And that's all I would say.Stan MannOkay. But in quantity, in dollar volume, you can't comment, potential dollar volume contribution?David StorchI think the State Department put up a release, which indicated the potential value up to $10 billion.Stan MannThatâs pretty good. Okay, thank you very much. Good job.David StorchOkay, thank you.OperatorAnd I'm showing no further questions or comments at this time.David StorchOkay. Well, once again, thank you for your participation. And I wish everybody a very good day. Take care.OperatorLadies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference.

As you can see, overall, we had a very good quarter as diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 38% from $0.21 last year to $0.29 in the current period. During the first quarter, we ramped up recently awarded programs on our Aviation Services segment and we continue to win significant new business from both our commercial and government customers. And if I may, I'm just going to highlight a few examples of some of our wins in the period.
We won contracts from both Enter Air and flydubai to provide power-by-the-hour component inventory management and repair services for more than 70 737 series aircraft. The latter agreement represents a significant expansion of AAR's commercial footprint in the Middle East and brings our total number of aircraft under management to over 1,200. We also signed an agreement with Asiana Airlines to provide landing gear repair services at our Miami Landing Gear facility. 
Further, we won a contract from CommutAir, which operates on behalf of the United Airlines as part of the United Express, to provide component repair and supply chain services for their fleet of 40 Embraer ERJ 145 aircraft.
Our airlift business was awarded 2 additional rotary-wing positions in Afghanistan, and in addition the Military Sealift Command extended our 4 positions providing vertical replenishment services in the Indian Ocean and Western Pacific. These awards bring our total contract positions to 21 aircraft as of the end of the quarter. And of course, most significantly, our airlift business also was awarded the Global Aviation Support Services contract for the Department of State air wing, otherwise known as the INL/A program. 
Our airlift will be responsible for operating, maintaining and provisioning a current fleet of 140 airplanes and helicopters operating around the world. The potential duration of this contract is 11 years, including a 6-month phase-in. The incumbent contractor filed a protest on September 11, and we expect a decision on the protest no later than December 21.
At this point, I want to thank you for your attention, and I'll turn the call over to Tim.
Tim Romenesko
Thanks, David. I'll discuss our first quarter financial performance in a bit more detail.
As David indicated, we had a good first quarter. Sales in the quarter were $404.8 million, up 4.7% versus the prior year. Aviation Services sales increased $18.8 million, or 6% year-over-year, while Expeditionary Services segment reported a slight decrease in sales, although up from Q4.

Gross profit increased year-over-year for both segments. The gross profit margin in Aviation Services was 16% with a mix of products and services responsible for the increase. In the Expeditionary Services' segment, the gross profit margin was 11.5, reflecting improved profitability in Mobility products.
Our SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales were 11.1% for the first quarter, compared to 10.3% last year. The SG&A expense run rate is about in line with our expectations, and we expect that the SG&A as a percentage of sales will decline closer to our target of 10% as sales increased over the balance of the fiscal year.
Now looking at interest expense for the quarter, it was $1.3 million compared to $1.9 million last year, and that's primarily as a result of the retirement of our remaining convertible notes during fiscal 2016. Our diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the first quarter was $0.29 compared to $0.21 in the prior year, and that's a 38% increase in EPS, as David had mentioned.
Now taking a look at cash for a moment, we used $0.5 million of cash from operations for the quarter. In the prior year first quarter, we used $64.4 million. Our capital expenditures in the quarter were $9.4 million and depreciation and amortization was $14.9 million.
During the period, during the quarter, we paid dividends of $2.6 million and we also repurchased approximately 619,000 shares of our stock in the open market for a price of $14.8 million. And that leaves us, as of August 31, with $67.9 million available under our Board-authorized share repurchase program.
Our net debt decreased $7.1 million and we ended with $143.7 million of net debt. And our net debt-to-capital ratio is low at 14%. Our composites manufacturing business has continued to perform well, and as a result, we decided to retain it within our Expeditionary Services segment. And we've reclassified this into continuing operations for all the periods presented.
So finally - so at this point, we are sticking to our guidance of $1.30 to $1.40. And we feel good about the quarter that just ended and we feel good about our outlook, but we're going to stick to our guidance at this point. So thanks for your interest. 
And I'll turn the call back over to David.
David Storch
Thank you, Tim. So as you can see, first quarter 2017 was a nice improvement. We saw a nice improvement over the prior year. Our Aviation Services segment continued to exhibit strong growth, and our Expeditionary Services segment improved from recent performance levels. Once again, we ended the quarter in excellent financial position, giving us not just stability and flexibility, but also capacity to go ahead and look to take advantage of market opportunities as they present themselves. We will continue to make investments in our industry-leading operations as we move into fiscal year 2017, and I'm excited about our future prospects.
At this time, I'll turn the call back over to the operator to open up the lines for any questions you may have.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And our first question or comment comes from the line of Larry Solow. Your line is now open.
Larry Solow
Great thanks. Good afternoon. I was wondering if you could just maybe just on the Aviation Services side, it looks like supply chain is doing really well, big growth there, obviously adding more contracts and whatnot. Aftermarket, anything changing there? Anything in your - in the trading business? And then perhaps a better look just on the MRO side and what's going on there, would be great.
David Storch
Well, MRO had, as I think we signaled in the past, MRO's results this quarter are the softest historically for the year. And they didn't disappoint in that regard this year. It was soft again. To give you a sense of positions we had, on average, let's call it, in the middle of August, we had about 33 positions. When I say positions, I mean, aircraft and the hangars for maintenance. And now, we're running at 44 or mid-40s, I should - 40, 40-ish right now, September, and then we go up to 44 in November. So it will start ramping again as the year progresses. 

The supply chain business, as you say, Larry, is strong. We're seeing many opportunities. John Holmes is not with us here today in Chicago because he's out visiting with customers trying to drum up some additional business and actually meeting with a customer in our New York facility today. So yes, we're expecting, we're hopeful that we can announce a contract after October 1 that we were working out for quite some time. That's a pretty good size. And I would say around the horn, the supply chain businesses are strong. Aviation, the MRO has gone through its typical, cyclical experience and strengthening. And we're feeling pretty good about where we are today.
Larry Solow
Okay. So the MRO is more seasonality than anything else. And how about just Lake Charles? I know there's been some headwinds there. Can you maybe just giveâ¦?
David Storch
Yes, we've been diminishing our footprint there. We're keeping it open for now for some light paint work type work. As we've discussed before, we - the State of Illinois has constructed a facility for us in Rockford that we're kind of pivoting towards. And hopefully, we'll be generating some revenue and income coming out of that facility in the not-too-distant future. We'll keep you up to speed on that.
Larry Solow
Got it. And just switching gears real quick on the Expeditionary side, it's I realize just sort of the, rather small numbers, and if you go back 3 years ago, gross profit was leagues higher, but a pretty nice improvement from the sort of low single digits to $8 million this quarter. And you said that was mostly on the Mobility side. I thought, I figured airlift also improved a little bit from the ramp in the Falkland Islands andâ¦
David Storch
Yes. Yes, the airlift has improved a little bit...
Larry Solow
And how about mobility? What's sort of your thoughts there?
David Storch
Well, our thoughts are that we're seeing signs of life in both businesses. So we are seeing the inquiry level get stronger, and we're not overcommitting at this point. So, let's see what happens. I mean, as you know, the world environment is unsettled as ever and it's just a question of how much more action will - the U.S. will see outside in these different theaters, and that will be a good proxy for how our businesses do.
Larry Solow
Okay. And then just on the INL contract, I don't know what you can or can't say. Thoughts on potential margin being at least accretive to your current margins or maybe just on timing, assuming the ramping starts up in the early calendar 2017, would that first 6 months be dilutive? Or would that - how would that ramp sort of play out on a high level, David.
David Storch
Why don't we hold off from making comments on the contract, it's in the protest period. And I think we'll talk about it once it emerges out of protest.
Larry Solow
That sounds great. Thanks David, appreciate it.
David Storch
Yeah, thank you.
Operator
Alright. And our next question or comment comes from the line of Kevin Ciabattoni with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
Kevin Ciabattoni
Hi good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions guys, nice quarter. 
David Storch
Sure, thanks.
Kevin Ciabattoni
On the SG&A, obviously, it's a little bit high in the quarter, 11% of revenue. In the press release, you guys talked about some new business development efforts that drove that. Just wondering if there's any more color you can give on those whether there's specific areas or programs you can discuss.
David Storch
Yes, so we've expanded our program selling capability, and I think what you're seeing here in some of these announcements is a reflection of their efforts. And we have a team of folks who joined us last year, and they're a wonderful team. They complement our organization in a very positive way. And we're very hopeful that we'll continue to benefit from their efforts. Also, first quarter is always a little softer for us because of MRO sales. But we anticipate - our goal is always to be below 10% and our goal is to get down to that level before the fiscal year is out.

Kevin Ciabattoni
Okay. Thanks David. On the composites business, obviously bringing that back in under Mobility. Can you just remind us, was said that under Mobility previously, or was that within the Aviation business?
David Storch
Yes. No, no, no, before, we had a manufacturing group of businesses, and it was - that's where it was. And when we sold off the businesses and we kind of restructured the manufacturing, we basically just stopped and looked to exit both the composites business and the metals business. We ultimately wound down the metals business, but the composite business, which we were trying to sell, we weren't able to get prices that we're happy with, so we thought it was best, from the customers' perspective, our people - for our people, et cetera, to go ahead and try to revitalize the business, which - and we've had some success in that regard. So, the business, based on how we see the markets unfolding, the leadership team at Mobility is a very capable leadership team, as you know. And they were eager to take on some added responsibility and they now have this operation as part of their business.
Kevin Ciabattoni
Can you may be touch on what maybe specific end markets are seeing or are driving that revitalization that you mentioned? Are there specific markets you can point to where you're starting to see some traction there?
David Storch
We've had success in the past and continue to have success serving some of the regional manufacturers. We've had some success on interiors for certain specialized aircraft. That business continues to be strong. So, I mean, we're looking at opportunities to support the Boeings of the world and the folks who support Boeing, as well some of the regional carriers that are out there as well. So, it's kind of like a niche-like business. We have some activity in the flat-panel world. And I don't know, Tim, is there anything else to add?
Tim Romenesko
No, that's pretty good. We're supporting some of the helicopter manufacturers. But that piece of the business has been doing pretty well.
Kevin Ciabattoni
Is that - is it mostly commercial or mostly military or a good mix of the 2?
Tim Romenesko
It's both, but it's - both, but it's mostly commercial.
Kevin Ciabattoni
Okay. And then last one for me. I know last quarter you guys mentioned that the engineering services business had a pretty nice quarter. I don't think you specifically called it out this quarter, but maybe just some color on what you're seeing there. I know - I think that tends to be a bit of a leading indicator for kind of the broader overhaul market, so maybe just some color on the engineering business.
David Storch
Yes, I think the engineering business has had a couple of wins. We had one out of Africa, actually. The business is doing okay. It's got some opportunities that they're looking at. But at this point in time, it's not a needle mover either way.
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And our next question or comment comes from the line of Stan Mann with Mann Family Investors. Your line is now open.
Stan Mann
Congratulations, a really good quarter.
David Storch
Thanks Stan.
Stan Mann
David, I have a question on priority use of cash as you generate. Would you say your emphasis is on buyback or acquisition? Or can you give us any color on what you think you'd utilize for in a priority basis?
David Storch
Yes. The first priority is to use our capital to grow our business, strengthen our franchise and improve the depth of product that we offer to our customers. So that would be our prime - that would be our first priority. Short of being able to increase the business in that fashion, we - and let me make that into a part A and Part B. Part A of that is external deal, let's say acquisitions. Part B is funding existing capability. In the quarter just ended for instance, we spent a fair amount of money funding inventory programs for our strategic customers. Then, next, I'd say, share repurchase would be next. And of course, the Board, every quarter, reviews our dividend, our dividend policy, and that's always discussed as well.

Stan Mann
Can you comment on whether you are close to or see viable deals, accretive deals, in what you're looking at now?
David Storch
We're seeing deals that are interesting. We're not seeing anything that is compelling necessarily, but we are seeing stuff out there. There's a fair amount of stuff that we're looking at. As you know, we're being very selective and disciplined, but I would say the deal flow on the acquisition side is moderate, light to moderate in a general sense.
Stan Mann
Okay. Last question is you've got - you've almost won the State Department contract for their fleet. So, if you look - let's assume we get that, do you see that as being accretive from a get-go? Or maybe you can't comment because of the challenge?
David Storch
Yes, Stan, so first of all, we were awarded the contract. 
Stan Mann
Yes.
David Storch
So we have a contract. The contract is under a protest - under the protest. We're issued a stay order by the customer or a stop order. So, we are not working. We are no longer working on that contract, but we do have a contract. In terms of the profitability or impact on company's results, we prefer not to discuss that at this stage.
Stan Mann
Okay. But it is a good contract for the company?
David Storch
Well, I prefer not to discuss it. I think it's a contract that - it's a program that we have a high level of confidence that - or well we know that we can deliver in a way that's superior to anything that the customer's accustomed to. And that's all I would say.
Stan Mann
Okay. But in quantity, in dollar volume, you can't comment, potential dollar volume contribution?
David Storch
I think the State Department put up a release, which indicated the potential value up to $10 billion.
Stan Mann
Thatâs pretty good. Okay, thank you very much. Good job.
David Storch
Okay, thank you.
Operator
And I'm showing no further questions or comments at this time.
David Storch
Okay. Well, once again, thank you for your participation. And I wish everybody a very good day. Take care.

We are joined today by David Storch, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Tim Romenesko, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer.Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that comments made during the call may include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 as noted in our news release and the Risk Factors section of the company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2016.In providing forward-looking statements, the company assumes no obligation to provide updates to reflect future circumstances or anticipated or unanticipated events. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to AAR's Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. David Storch.David StorchThank you very much and good afternoon, and thank you for joining us to discuss our second quarter 2017 results. Let me begin by just saying that John Holmes is not here with us in Chicago today. He is out on assignment, trying to make us some money. So, weâll try to answer questions related to his area more specifically. Before we begin the recap of the quarter, Iâd like to say how proud we are to have been awarded the Worldwide Aviation Support Services Contract by the U.S. State Department. We are very pleased that the GAO found no merit to the award protest filed by DynCorp and that stands by the State Departments decision to award AAR the contract. We do believe and we see where DynCorp will be fighting some more on this contract. We feel at this stage it is, as we have along the road, fairly frivolous but we will fight them every way along the way and have a lot of confidence in the State Departmentâs decision and a lot of confidence in our ability to bring value to the State Department.Now the GAO decision clears the path now for AAR to assume operations and in the coming days we will work with the Department of State to establish a transition plan for INL/A. While we do not have more to share at this point, we expect to be in a position to provide further details of the transition timing, as well as guidance during our next call.Now back to Q2 results. We had another solid quarter as diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 35% from $0.26 last year to $0.35 in the current period. Although revenue was down 1.8% or $7.7 million for the quarter as a result of two significant item, one is the KC10 wind down, which we discussed before and secondly to drive more profitability to our MRO operations, we are transitioning our Lake Charles facility from a comprehensive MRO provider to a more limited operation providing principally only painting services.As we continue to expand our MRO foot print early this month, we had our grand opening for Rockford, which is our sixth MRO constructed and designed to allow us to maintain every commercial aircraft up to and including the A380. For those of you not familiar, Rockford is about a 90 minute drive from downtown Chicago, itâs accessible to a very large labor pool and weâre very excited to have this facility here in the state of Illinois.The facility was funded largely by the state and Federal Government and from local bankers and Rockford kicked in as well. We have very favorable lease agreement and weâre very excited to move into the facility and start doing work for new customers. Overall our Aviation Services business have continued to perform well and we captured several important contracts during the quarter. For example, we signed a five-year agreement valued at $125 million to provide power by the hour, component inventory management repair services to South African Airways Technical or SAAT. The agreement with SAAT represents a significant expansion or AAR in Africa and this win was largely due to the effort of our new President of AAR Africa, Cheryle Jackson, who has been working at the company since 2010 and President of AAR Africa in the last year and this is a very meaningful win for the company.The company has a solidified position in Africa last few years, including signing its first power by the hour component inventory management and repair services contract in 2014 with Kenya Airways to support their fleet of 737s. We also entered into a long term contract with New Zealand, Air New Zealand to provide nose-to-tail cost for flight hour notable inventory support covering a wide range of parts on 15 for their 777 fleet, which is â they have 15 777s that they operate.This contract represents AARâs first power-by-the-hour agreement solely focused on the 777 aircraft and complements our other programs in the Asia-Pacific region. This additional contract also brings our total number of Aircraft under management to over 1300 aircraft. We signaled before weâve made a significant investment in the BD capability around soliciting for more of this type of work and we expect to be more successful with programs as the year materializes.During the quarter, we also expanded our distribution relationship with Eaton to include certain products manufactured by its Aerospace Groupâs fuel and motion control systems division and now includes refueling sub-systems, fuel pumps, door and landing gear actuators, secondary flight control systems, and piece part sub-assemblies.Overall, Iâm very pleased with our progress during this period. The INL/A award is very meaningful and we look forward to working closely with the Department of State to improve their operating efficiencies as we have done consistently for other government agencies and their alliance around the world. Iâll now turn the call over to Tim to discuss the financials for the period.Tim RomeneskoThanks, David. I'll discuss our second quarter financial performance in a bit more detail. As David indicated, we had a good second quarter with earnings per share of $0.35 compared to $0.26 in the prior year, which was a 35% increase. Our sales were down slightly as David mentioned due to the KC10 and Lake Charles transitions. Our Expeditionary services business experienced increased revenues of $5.2 million or 7.2% versus prior year, and net income was up by $4.1 million in the quarter.Gross profit in the Aviation Services segment decreased $2.2 million or 3.8%, driven by the lower sales volume and the KC10 program wind down. Gross profit in Expeditionary Services segment increased $9.3 million with improved profitability across both businesses. SG&A expenses in the quarter increased $3.2 million, reflecting increased investments in business development activities. Interest expense for the quarter was $1.1 million, compared to $1.5 million previously in the previous period, primarily as a result of retirement of our remaining convertible notes. CapEx in the quarter was $9.5 million much of that around technology investments across the company, depreciation and amortization was $14.3 million. During the quarter, we paid dividends of $2.6 million or $0.075 a share and the average diluted share count for the quarter was 34.1 million, compared to 34.6 million in the second quarter last year. As of November 30, we had $67.9 million available under our Board authorized share repurchase plan. And during the quarter, we reduced our net debt by $3.4 million, compared to the first quarter, while continuing to make investments in working capital to fund the sequential sales growth and also invest in assets to support our new programs.Finally, we entered into an amendment to our revolving credit agreement, which extended the maturity of this agreement to November 2021 and modified certain provisions including the elimination of the material adverse change covenant. So, now Iâll turn the call back over to David for final comments.David StorchThanks Tim, and if I may, just reflecting back on the period and where the company is today and where we are headed, Iâm very pleased with our ability to expand our geographic footprint and you saw some of those as evidenced in the contracts we have recently secured. Iâm very pleased with the product range. We've gone ahead and expanded the product category, the product types of inventory that weâre selling to our customers and Iâm also pleased with the range of customers and the INL/A contract is a significant move for us and to the Department of State and weâre just coming out of the period and feeling really good and entering our second half with a lot of momentum. So with that, let me open it up for any questions.Question-and-Answer SessionOperatorThank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Larry Solow of CJS Securities.Larry SolowGood afternoon. David you sound, obviously pretty positive taking someone to doing pretty well, just curious on the KC10, is that wind down occurring any faster than you thought or is that sort of in line with your thinking?David StorchNo, it is pretty much in line with what we thought. I mean last year was kind of - so what we communicated after we lost the contract with an average of what the business has produced over the prior three-year period and then we recently kind of signaled what itâs performed over the last year and last year was actually one of the stronger year's that weâve seen in some time. So when you do comparisons year-over-year, there is obviously a negative comparison. So, it will continue to wind down in Q3 and there will be some minor tail in Q4, but very insignificant.Larry SolowOkay. And then just on the Lake Charles case too, I think the shift out just to the painting is, you know you told it would have several quarters, Iâm supposed that piece has never actually turned profitable, so maybe it is just an impact on revenue, but not on things like that.David StorchYes, thatâs the way to look at it Larry. So, we took our actions, we have always struggled with profitability there and we just decided once we were able to come online in Rockford as there was no reason to continue chasing that business the way we had been. So, we feel good about that change from earnings efficiency standpoint.Larry SolowGot it. And just on the fully expected not to be able to comment too much on the INL contract, but it sounds like you expect maybe DynCorp is not done yet in terms of protesting or appealing or may not be that easy, you know so we may not know for a little bit onâ¦David StorchNo, no, no. Actually letâs, just to clarify that. So the State Department awarded as the contract back on September 1. The GAO reviewed and DynCorp probably filed the protest. That was fully expected. The GAO considered their protest and denied the protest, which in essence starts the process between ourselves and the State. Now at the same time they have further DynCorp can now go to the, whatâs it called, the Court of Claims or something like that. Federal court of claims to pursue their claim, but obviously Larry listen, this is an important contract for DynCorp, itâs important from a standpoint of their insolvency from all appearances, and you know theyâre going to keep fighting and theyâre going to fight until they can't, but I think itâs been pretty clear that the customers made their selection, the GAO and has gone ahead and upheld the customers selection. We feel very confident that our solution set is unique and superior to anything and anybody else can offer. We were able to blend in best practices from across our network of things that we are doing as a company and I think the State Department saw a value and the GAO basically affirmed that. So Dyn is going to continue I believe down a frivolous path and we are fully prepared to defend our position and the work weâve done and look forward in supporting the State in the way that the State, we believe the state will be very satisfied with their selection when they reflect that a few us through years down the path.Larry SolowGot it. Great. And just lastly, just on expeditionary services outside of that contract, a second consecutive obviously bouncing off to the bottom and far below where it was a few years ago, but nice little improvement if you look sequentially over the last few quarters, is that being driven by it sounds like both segments are improving a little bit, I guess the falcon Islands contract is ramped up, any thoughts on that and on the mobility side would be great, thanks.David StorchYes, so the mobility business has a little bit of momentum. The airlift business is doing a good job watching our expenses and we created and we share with us while back ago trading operations down there. We've had some success down there with being able to move assets and weâre competing for new positions and we feel pretty good and team is very excited with the win of the INL/A contract as well.Larry SolowGot you. Great thanks. Appreciate it.David StorchYes.OperatorThank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Shannon Burke of Gabelli and Co.Shannon BurkeHi good evening.David StorchHi Shannon.Shannon BurkeSo, just on the Aviation Services decline, it is a touch on Larry's question, how quickly do you expect the decline and the wind down in the KC10 to be offset by new program gains? I know you called that out in the press release, but will it start to pick up?David StorchI would say by the fourth quarter and first quarter you will start seeing the gains from programs offset the losses from KC10 and then once we start the revenue stream from the INL/A we will be right there with whatever sales declines we have from the KC10.Shannon BurkeRight, right. Okay. Thank you for that. And then is there any progress on announcement for a Rockford facility tenant or is that still expected to happen in December. David StorchYes. We are working very hard. December probably at this stage probably not. We've had some drop in work.Shannon BurkeOkay.David StorchWe performed some maintenance work for a couple of customers. We are in discussion with a few different carriers. We maintain confidence. We don't start paying rent until we have a base load customer. So, we are out there aggressively talking with people. We have hired our first 30 group of mechanics, and we are in the process of interviewing more and we are hoping that we can be up to work as early as the middle of January, may be February with some business. Thatâs what we are hoping for at this stage.Shannon BurkeOkay. And then that would convert into revenue pretty quickly than Iâm assuming once again?David StorchYes.Shannon BurkeOkay. And then just on the Expeditionary Services segment with the Trump administration coming in, he is really focused on reducing cost and watching spending in the DOD budget, have you seen any activity from potential customers or what is your viewpoint because this obviously would be a great benefit to AAR.David StorchSo my view is that we offer alternative solutions for the government and typically our solutions are lower cost in nature and weâre fairly optimistic that as the needs continue to grow and the pressure comes to contain cost that weâre in a pretty good position. So, itâs a little hard to predict precisely how the behavior will unfold, come January 20, but we think weâre in a good position to benefit at least from the signals that weâre seeing so far.Shannon BurkeOkay. Great, thank you so much.David StorchThank you, Shannon.OperatorSpeakers Iâm showing no further questions at this time. Iâll turn the call back over to you Mr. Storch for closing comments.David StorchWell thank you very much and Iâd like to wish everybody a very happy holiday and a New Year filled with peace, happiness, and a dose of prosperity.

Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to AAR's Fiscal Year 2017 Second Quarter Earnings Call. We are joined today by David Storch, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Tim Romenesko, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer.
Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that comments made during the call may include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 as noted in our news release and the Risk Factors section of the company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2016.
In providing forward-looking statements, the company assumes no obligation to provide updates to reflect future circumstances or anticipated or unanticipated events. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to AAR's Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. David Storch.
David Storch
Thank you very much and good afternoon, and thank you for joining us to discuss our second quarter 2017 results. Let me begin by just saying that John Holmes is not here with us in Chicago today. He is out on assignment, trying to make us some money. So, weâll try to answer questions related to his area more specifically. Before we begin the recap of the quarter, Iâd like to say how proud we are to have been awarded the Worldwide Aviation Support Services Contract by the U.S. State Department. 
We are very pleased that the GAO found no merit to the award protest filed by DynCorp and that stands by the State Departments decision to award AAR the contract. We do believe and we see where DynCorp will be fighting some more on this contract. We feel at this stage it is, as we have along the road, fairly frivolous but we will fight them every way along the way and have a lot of confidence in the State Departmentâs decision and a lot of confidence in our ability to bring value to the State Department.
Now the GAO decision clears the path now for AAR to assume operations and in the coming days we will work with the Department of State to establish a transition plan for INL/A. While we do not have more to share at this point, we expect to be in a position to provide further details of the transition timing, as well as guidance during our next call.
Now back to Q2 results. We had another solid quarter as diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 35% from $0.26 last year to $0.35 in the current period. Although revenue was down 1.8% or $7.7 million for the quarter as a result of two significant item, one is the KC10 wind down, which we discussed before and secondly to drive more profitability to our MRO operations, we are transitioning our Lake Charles facility from a comprehensive MRO provider to a more limited operation providing principally only painting services.
As we continue to expand our MRO foot print early this month, we had our grand opening for Rockford, which is our sixth MRO constructed and designed to allow us to maintain every commercial aircraft up to and including the A380. For those of you not familiar, Rockford is about a 90 minute drive from downtown Chicago, itâs accessible to a very large labor pool and weâre very excited to have this facility here in the state of Illinois.
The facility was funded largely by the state and Federal Government and from local bankers and Rockford kicked in as well. We have very favorable lease agreement and weâre very excited to move into the facility and start doing work for new customers. 
Overall our Aviation Services business have continued to perform well and we captured several important contracts during the quarter. For example, we signed a five-year agreement valued at $125 million to provide power by the hour, component inventory management repair services to South African Airways Technical or SAAT. The agreement with SAAT represents a significant expansion or AAR in Africa and this win was largely due to the effort of our new President of AAR Africa, Cheryle Jackson, who has been working at the company since 2010 and President of AAR Africa in the last year and this is a very meaningful win for the company.

The company has a solidified position in Africa last few years, including signing its first power by the hour component inventory management and repair services contract in 2014 with Kenya Airways to support their fleet of 737s. We also entered into a long term contract with New Zealand, Air New Zealand to provide nose-to-tail cost for flight hour notable inventory support covering a wide range of parts on 15 for their 777 fleet, which is â they have 15 777s that they operate.
This contract represents AARâs first power-by-the-hour agreement solely focused on the 777 aircraft and complements our other programs in the Asia-Pacific region. This additional contract also brings our total number of Aircraft under management to over 1300 aircraft. We signaled before weâve made a significant investment in the BD capability around soliciting for more of this type of work and we expect to be more successful with programs as the year materializes.
During the quarter, we also expanded our distribution relationship with Eaton to include certain products manufactured by its Aerospace Groupâs fuel and motion control systems division and now includes refueling sub-systems, fuel pumps, door and landing gear actuators, secondary flight control systems, and piece part sub-assemblies.
Overall, Iâm very pleased with our progress during this period. The INL/A award is very meaningful and we look forward to working closely with the Department of State to improve their operating efficiencies as we have done consistently for other government agencies and their alliance around the world. 
Iâll now turn the call over to Tim to discuss the financials for the period.
Tim Romenesko
Thanks, David. I'll discuss our second quarter financial performance in a bit more detail. As David indicated, we had a good second quarter with earnings per share of $0.35 compared to $0.26 in the prior year, which was a 35% increase. Our sales were down slightly as David mentioned due to the KC10 and Lake Charles transitions. Our Expeditionary services business experienced increased revenues of $5.2 million or 7.2% versus prior year, and net income was up by $4.1 million in the quarter.
Gross profit in the Aviation Services segment decreased $2.2 million or 3.8%, driven by the lower sales volume and the KC10 program wind down. Gross profit in Expeditionary Services segment increased $9.3 million with improved profitability across both businesses. 
SG&A expenses in the quarter increased $3.2 million, reflecting increased investments in business development activities. Interest expense for the quarter was $1.1 million, compared to $1.5 million previously in the previous period, primarily as a result of retirement of our remaining convertible notes. 
CapEx in the quarter was $9.5 million much of that around technology investments across the company, depreciation and amortization was $14.3 million. During the quarter, we paid dividends of $2.6 million or $0.075 a share and the average diluted share count for the quarter was 34.1 million, compared to 34.6 million in the second quarter last year. 
As of November 30, we had $67.9 million available under our Board authorized share repurchase plan. And during the quarter, we reduced our net debt by $3.4 million, compared to the first quarter, while continuing to make investments in working capital to fund the sequential sales growth and also invest in assets to support our new programs.
Finally, we entered into an amendment to our revolving credit agreement, which extended the maturity of this agreement to November 2021 and modified certain provisions including the elimination of the material adverse change covenant. 
So, now Iâll turn the call back over to David for final comments.
David Storch
Thanks Tim, and if I may, just reflecting back on the period and where the company is today and where we are headed, Iâm very pleased with our ability to expand our geographic footprint and you saw some of those as evidenced in the contracts we have recently secured. Iâm very pleased with the product range. We've gone ahead and expanded the product category, the product types of inventory that weâre selling to our customers and Iâm also pleased with the range of customers and the INL/A contract is a significant move for us and to the Department of State and weâre just coming out of the period and feeling really good and entering our second half with a lot of momentum. 

So with that, let me open it up for any questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Larry Solow of CJS Securities.
Larry Solow
Good afternoon. David you sound, obviously pretty positive taking someone to doing pretty well, just curious on the KC10, is that wind down occurring any faster than you thought or is that sort of in line with your thinking?
David Storch
No, it is pretty much in line with what we thought. I mean last year was kind of - so what we communicated after we lost the contract with an average of what the business has produced over the prior three-year period and then we recently kind of signaled what itâs performed over the last year and last year was actually one of the stronger year's that weâve seen in some time. So when you do comparisons year-over-year, there is obviously a negative comparison. So, it will continue to wind down in Q3 and there will be some minor tail in Q4, but very insignificant.
Larry Solow
Okay. And then just on the Lake Charles case too, I think the shift out just to the painting is, you know you told it would have several quarters, Iâm supposed that piece has never actually turned profitable, so maybe it is just an impact on revenue, but not on things like that.
David Storch
Yes, thatâs the way to look at it Larry. So, we took our actions, we have always struggled with profitability there and we just decided once we were able to come online in Rockford as there was no reason to continue chasing that business the way we had been. So, we feel good about that change from earnings efficiency standpoint.
Larry Solow
Got it. And just on the fully expected not to be able to comment too much on the INL contract, but it sounds like you expect maybe DynCorp is not done yet in terms of protesting or appealing or may not be that easy, you know so we may not know for a little bit onâ¦
David Storch
No, no, no. Actually letâs, just to clarify that. So the State Department awarded as the contract back on September 1. The GAO reviewed and DynCorp probably filed the protest. That was fully expected. The GAO considered their protest and denied the protest, which in essence starts the process between ourselves and the State. Now at the same time they have further DynCorp can now go to the, whatâs it called, the Court of Claims or something like that. Federal court of claims to pursue their claim, but obviously Larry listen, this is an important contract for DynCorp, itâs important from a standpoint of their insolvency from all appearances, and you know theyâre going to keep fighting and theyâre going to fight until they can't, but I think itâs been pretty clear that the customers made their selection, the GAO and has gone ahead and upheld the customers selection. 
We feel very confident that our solution set is unique and superior to anything and anybody else can offer. We were able to blend in best practices from across our network of things that we are doing as a company and I think the State Department saw a value and the GAO basically affirmed that. So Dyn is going to continue I believe down a frivolous path and we are fully prepared to defend our position and the work weâve done and look forward in supporting the State in the way that the State, we believe the state will be very satisfied with their selection when they reflect that a few us through years down the path.
Larry Solow
Got it. Great. And just lastly, just on expeditionary services outside of that contract, a second consecutive obviously bouncing off to the bottom and far below where it was a few years ago, but nice little improvement if you look sequentially over the last few quarters, is that being driven by it sounds like both segments are improving a little bit, I guess the falcon Islands contract is ramped up, any thoughts on that and on the mobility side would be great, thanks.

David Storch
Yes, so the mobility business has a little bit of momentum. The airlift business is doing a good job watching our expenses and we created and we share with us while back ago trading operations down there. We've had some success down there with being able to move assets and weâre competing for new positions and we feel pretty good and team is very excited with the win of the INL/A contract as well.
Larry Solow
Got you. Great thanks. Appreciate it.
David Storch
Yes.
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Shannon Burke of Gabelli and Co.
Shannon Burke
Hi good evening.
David Storch
Hi Shannon.
Shannon Burke
So, just on the Aviation Services decline, it is a touch on Larry's question, how quickly do you expect the decline and the wind down in the KC10 to be offset by new program gains? I know you called that out in the press release, but will it start to pick up?
David Storch
I would say by the fourth quarter and first quarter you will start seeing the gains from programs offset the losses from KC10 and then once we start the revenue stream from the INL/A we will be right there with whatever sales declines we have from the KC10.
Shannon Burke
Right, right. Okay. Thank you for that. And then is there any progress on announcement for a Rockford facility tenant or is that still expected to happen in December. 
David Storch
Yes. We are working very hard. December probably at this stage probably not. We've had some drop in work.
Shannon Burke
Okay.
David Storch
We performed some maintenance work for a couple of customers. We are in discussion with a few different carriers. We maintain confidence. We don't start paying rent until we have a base load customer. So, we are out there aggressively talking with people. We have hired our first 30 group of mechanics, and we are in the process of interviewing more and we are hoping that we can be up to work as early as the middle of January, may be February with some business. Thatâs what we are hoping for at this stage.
Shannon Burke
Okay. And then that would convert into revenue pretty quickly than Iâm assuming once again?
David Storch
Yes.
Shannon Burke
Okay. And then just on the Expeditionary Services segment with the Trump administration coming in, he is really focused on reducing cost and watching spending in the DOD budget, have you seen any activity from potential customers or what is your viewpoint because this obviously would be a great benefit to AAR.
David Storch
So my view is that we offer alternative solutions for the government and typically our solutions are lower cost in nature and weâre fairly optimistic that as the needs continue to grow and the pressure comes to contain cost that weâre in a pretty good position. So, itâs a little hard to predict precisely how the behavior will unfold, come January 20, but we think weâre in a good position to benefit at least from the signals that weâre seeing so far.
Shannon Burke
Okay. Great, thank you so much.
David Storch
Thank you, Shannon.
Operator
Speakers Iâm showing no further questions at this time. Iâll turn the call back over to you Mr. Storch for closing comments.
David Storch

Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to AAR's Fiscal Year 2017 Third Quarter Earnings Call. We are joined today by David Storch, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Tim Romenesko, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, John Holmes, Vice President and Chief Operating Officer of Aviation Services.
Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that the comments made during the call may include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. as noted in our news release and the Risk Factors section of the company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2016. In providing forward-looking statements, the company assumes no obligation to provide updates to reflect future circumstances or anticipated or unanticipated events.
At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to AAR's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, David Storch.
David Storch
Thank you, Star and good afternoon. Thanks for all for joining us here today to discuss our third quarter 2017 results.
We're pleased with the growth coming from our inventory programs activity, supporting commercial airline and during the quarter we captured several important new contracts. Let me start with Allegiant. Allegiant has a fleet of A320 aircraft, currently 36 with a plan to expand up to 100 and we signed a contract with them to provide power by the hour component support in support of that fleet.
Also, SkyWest, we build on our relationship that dates back to the 90s whereby we signed a three-year agreement to provide landing gear overhaul and exchange services for SkyWest. The agreement covers landing gear assembly, subassemblies on fleet of more than 400 Bombardier CRJ aircraft. It's a contract that as an option to expand up to five years.
Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we signed an agreement with India's largest airline, IndiGo, to provide landing gear overall services on their fleet of A320, which is 49. These will be for full ship sets. The agreement expands both our footprint, the Asia-Pacific region and our relationship with IndiGo.
These contract awards build on the momentum from earlier in the year as we were successful winning work across a broad geographic footprint in addition to expanding our customer base and the aircraft fleet type coverage.
Last quarter we announced a new five-year contract valued at $125 million with South African Airways to provide power by the hour component inventory, management repair services across their fleet of aircraft. We also previously announced a new long-term contract with Air New Zealand to provide nose-to-tail cost for flight hour notable inventory support for 15 of their fleet of 777.
Theyâll start providing services under these contracts and are excited about the opportunity that these wins provide to the company. Our geographic reach expanded during the quarter as we opened a parts warehouse at Dubai World Central Airport. The supply chain hub closes the gap between central aircraft components and the growing list of commercial and regional carriers operating in a growing Gulf State region.
The warehouse enables us to leverage our partnerships with industry-leading OEM such as Eaton, Unison, Meggitt and Lord to stock the warehouse with a wide array of factory-new parts. So, when an operator has an aircraft as grounded, we can get them the needed part to the aircraft quickly.
We're starting to see an uptick in activity around our businesses that are impacted by the government's operational tempo. We've had a pickup in business in our palette throughout the whole fiscal year and that work continues and we're getting noise coming out of the commanders in the Middle East about need for support in the regions there as well.

Before we begin our financial recap of the quarter, I would like to give an update on the INL/A Contract awarded to AAR Airlift by the US State Department. The incumbent contract continues to protest the award is currently being heard by the U.S. Court of Federal Claims for final resolution and we expect to file decision from the court no later than August 2017.
We are highly confident that the court will dismiss the claims made by DynCorp and will stand by the State Department's decision to award AAR the contract. You may recall, we are originally selected by the state on September 1. We cleared the first protest with a ruling by the GAO in December.
The lawyers in the COFC case remanded the decision back to the State Department contracting officer who then reaffirmed his decision once again in the selection of AAR as the contract for this contract and as I indicated the ruling is now in front of the COFC and we do expect a ruling before August is out.
Now back to Q3 results, we had another solid quarter as diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 31% from $0.29 last year and $0.38 in the current period. Revenue was up 8.4% or $34.6 million for the quarter primarily as a result of increased sales in our aviation services segment. We had considerable strength in our supply chain businesses to commercial airlines, partially offset by the downsizing of our Lake Charles facility and a reduction in sales from our phaseout of the KC10 program.
So, as we sit here today, overall, we're very pleased with the progress during the quarter and we have strong momentum coming into our fourth quarter and feel really good about our overall positioning in the market.
With that, I'd like to turn it over the Tim for a little bit more detail.
Tim Romenesko
Thanks a lot David. So, I'll give a little bit more detail on the quarter.
As David mentioned, we had strong quarter with earnings per share of $0.38 compared to $0.29 last year, which is a 31% increase. Good sales growth, 9.6% growth in aviation services. Income from continuing operations was up by $3.2 million in the quarter. The gross profit increased $4.8 million at aviation services segment due to the increased sales volumes and gross profit in expeditionary services increased $4.9 million with improved profitability across our businesses there.
SG&A expenses increased $4.3 million in the quarter reflecting increased legal fees related to the INL program that David talked about as well as investments in other business development activities. Interest expense in the quarter is $1.4 million down a bit from last year, primarily as a result of retirement of some of our convertible notes.
CapEx in the quarter was $9.1 million, depreciation and amortization $14.7. Also during the quarter, we paid dividends of $2.5 million or $0.075 a share and we repurchased approximately 52,000 shares in the open market for $1.7 million.
As of the end of the quarter, we had 6.1 million remaining available under our Board authorized share repurchase plan. Our average diluted share count for the quarter was 34.2 million compared to 34.4 million in the third quarter last year. Net debt increased $22.4 million from the second quarter as we continue to make strategic investments in our business, including assets to support our new multi-year supply chain management programs supporting our customers.
Thanks again for your interest and I'll turn the call back over to David for concluding comments.
David Storch
Well done, Tim. Once again good quarter and what I'd like to do now is open up and take questions that you may have out there.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Larry Solow of CJS Securities. Your line is open.

Larry Solow
Great. Thanks. Good afternoon. David I was wondering if you could or Tim could just help just give us a little more color on the very strong quarter in aviation services. I was expecting a solid quarter, but I thought after last quarter KC10 you might see a little more impact from that.
Well perhaps there was, but it looks like maybe some of your other contracts ramped up, but normally is seasonally a little slow quarter to sequentially a pretty nice improvement and obviously a 10% growth with the impact of KC10 and also Lake Charles. So maybe you can just give us a little more color on that.
David Storch
Lots of strength in the parts businesses across the Board to commercial customers. So, we're getting traction from some of our program wins, but I believe we're doing really good job across all the different businesses in that segment.
Larry Solow
Is this kind of high single-digit growth even forgetting the KC10 impact which actually would make it even higher maybe as you look out, but is this something you think is sustainable or was there some timing relation anything in this quarter that made it a little bit of an aberration or not?
David Storch
Nothing that stands out. I think we had a good results throughout the businesses. I think we're starting to benefit from some of the investments we've made and some of the actions we've taken in prior periods. So yeah, I think you can see hopefully continued performance coming from our parts businesses.
Larry Solow
Great. Excellent. Really strong quarter and then just on the expeditionary services, just a little weaker sequentially. I think I know you get lost a couple positions in Afghanistan, but anything else that does sound like really materialistic sound like that should be hopefully getting better and then obviously until the INL contract comes in, but that's independent of that?
David Storch
Right. Larry, so there is a lot of noise coming out of the market that is kind of indicative of demand about to come. We havenât seen it yet, but we're getting a sense that there may be some positive stuff out there for us. Now we've had before, but currently at least there is some noise indicating that there may be some interest in our services.
Larry Solow
Okay. Great. And just one last question, just on the cost side, did the $1.4 million, I guess that's included in your numbers right. That's like a recent impact or whatever.
David Storch
Yes.
Larry Solow
And I know you've incurred some costs for that, just in terms of building up the program, but in terms of legal costs, this is probably higher than the normal run rate I would imaging.
David Storch
Yes. That's correct. That's correct. We've had legal expenses throughout on this program, but we're pointing it out and that's correct. That's already absorbed in our results
Larry Solow
And just how about the growth in SG&A still pretty high. I realize you had pretty nice revenue growth, but I think if you take out that charge or that expense, it was still like 8%, 9%. So, close to your revenue growth. Any thoughts on that and is thatâ¦
David Storch
Well, we're very driven to bring our SG&A down to historical levels below 10%. So, we would be happy being in the 9% and 9.5% range. Today we're at 10.6%. If you take out the legal expenses, you get a few basis point reduction, but basically what we're counting on right here is to get some sales growth.
Larry Solow
Got it. Okay. Fair enough. Thanks. I appreciate it.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Ciarmoli of SunTrust. Your line is open.
Michael Ciarmoli
Hey, good evening, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe just to stay on the topic of legal, do you guys expect that that sort of expense level to continue at least until this decision has been made in that August timeframe?

David Storch
Yeah, I would say so.
Michael Ciarmoli
Okay. And then staying on INL, anything obviously early stages of budget planning, looking at Trump's proposals, planning on you really taking the hatchet to the Department of State, I would assume this would be something that would be this level of spend given the importance to order security drug interdiction, is there any concern about the funding level for INL going forward?
David Storch
We've been led to believe no, but obviously, the current planning is outside of our purview if you will, but we've been led to believe that there will be little to no impact.
Michael Ciarmoli
Okay. Perfect. And then just on back to that growth in the aviation services, can you guys give any color, certainly you're seeing strength, you mentioned the parts business, are you guys seeing, we've had sort of this deferral of shop visits over the prior years. Are you guys starting to see some of these airline customers start to spend given where fuel prices are or just any color you guys are seeing on the behavioral patterns of your airline customers?
David Storch
I think what you're seeing from our vantage point is more of a market share grab on our part. You've seen some new wins and growth with new customers. So, I think the spending patterns with our customer base that may be noticeable in that regard. I just think in AAR's case, I think what you're seeing is growth in our market share.
Michael Ciarmoli
Okay. And what's driving those market share gains and who are you taking the share from?
David Storch
Well, we made a significant investment in BD capability around this program activity and you're seeing some of the fruits of that effort in energy and I think we're just doing a better job geographic dispersion of our -- the balance of our supply businesses. There's a reason for opening up a plant in Dubai and I think our guys are executing -- our guys and gals are executing beautifully.
Michael Ciarmoli
Got it. Fair enough. And then last one, just any thoughts, Boeing making some pretty aggressive statements about coming into the product support business. I don't know how they're going to get to their targeted revenue levels unless they actually start to buy their way into the aftermarket.
Any thoughts on what Boeing's decision to get more aggressive in the product support aftermarket for you guys? Have you seen anything at Boeing or do you view that as a risk and opportunity?
David Storch
Yes, our relationship with Boeing, which would be similar to some of the other large OEs would be in some cases we compete, in some cases we supply, in some cases, we purchase. So, to date, our relationship with Boeing have not really been impacted by any of their announcements in any meaningful fashion and we would anticipate -- we don't see much in a way of change. We're very cognizant of their statements and we're focused on execution here at the company and expanding our capabilities and continue doing our things.
So yes, we're aware of them. We're aware of their ambitions, but yet we've not seen any change in terms of our relationship with them.
Michael Ciarmoli
Got it. Helpful. Thanks a lot guys.
Operator
[Operator instructions] Our next question comes from the line of [Ben Cleave of Noble Capital Markets]. Your question please.
Unidentified Analyst
All right. Thank you. So, couple of questions for you guys. First regarding the pipeline, I am wondering in the past you've kind of alluded to the fact that you want to diversify your expeditionary services business through your pipeline expansion. I'm wondering your existing pipeline right now, if you could kind of give us rough estimate of what you have in aviation services versus expeditionary?
And then the expeditionary pipeline, to what degree would that continue to diversify that business?

David Storch
Well, let me first start by saying that I think what you're seeing in our announcement is a bullish attitude around our aviation service business particularly sporting commercial customers. We also see opportunities supporting government customers and are awaiting hopefully some positive news on a few different fronts that we're working on.
In terms of our expeditionary service work last year, you may recall that we expanded with the search and rescue contract down in the Falklands in support of the British MOD and we continue to look for opportunities of that nature pretty much around the globe.
Our BD team is working fairly aggressively. I'm not in position today report on any progress per se, but I would be hopeful that a year from now or so that we would have some successful stories to communicate.
Unidentified Analyst
Okay. Thank you. And with regards to the flurry of activity you've seen over the last couple of quarters with these new contracts, looking into Q4, I am wondering on if you expect any of these contracts to be particularly dilutive or meaningful cash consumers and I am really curious any in particular I am wondering about the South African Airways in fact.
David Storch
Yes, so we would be hopeful that most of -- in terms of the contracts that we've announced that most of the spend has already taken place. So, we would anticipate positive cash flows coming from those investments. That's said, I wouldn't want to limit us to around new contracts that might be in the pipeline as well.
So, we have been growing at fairly significant clip. Some of these programs require capital. Some programs require less capital, but we are to answer your question in terms of the current order book, we would anticipate positive cash flows and then we may be making similar investments if we're successful in another contracts of this nature.

Okay. Thank you. And so, I guess along that line then, expect for any potential new awards that come up and it's fair to say that your CapEx spend for Q4 isn't going to be enough kind of legacy $7 million or $10 million.
David Storch
Yes, I think that's a good way to look at yes.
Unidentified Analyst
Okay. Perfect. That does it for me. Thank you, guys.
David Storch
Okay. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Shannon Burke of Gabelli. Your line is open.
Shannon Burke
Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question.
David Storch
Hi Shannon.
Shannon Burke
So just starting with the aviation services segment and the new contract with IndiGo, so did you win this contact away from a competitor or were they currently doing it in house and do you think that your expansion with the Dubai center had anything to do with that?
David Storch
Yes, so the IndiGo contract is more of a labor contract. So, it's a maintenance contract to support their island gear and that would've been business we won away from competition.
Shannon Burke
Okay. Great. Thank you so much. And then switching to expeditionary, so could you just go over how many fine positions you had at the end of the quarter versus in 2016?
David Storch
I think we had 16 at the end of the quarter and I'm not sure what we had in 2016? And we can get back to you on that Shannon. We'll get back to you.
Shannon Burke
Okay. Great. Thanks so much. And so, is this gross profit level, is that about little under 9%, is that the new run rate level given the number five position under the INL contact comes on or how should we think about that?
David Storch
Yes, so there is a little bit of volatility quarter-to-quarter just based on how the other businesses within that segment perform. So, I would say plus or minus where we should be in that range.
Shannon Burke
Okay. But the Falkland Island contract is still performing well.

David Storch
It is.
Shannon Burke
Okay. Great. And then in the mobility business, you said you're seeing some noise. Is there anything that you are seeing in the budget given the recapitalization of military? Is there any prospects you see and then I guess that also goes a long way to what Michael was asking?
David Storch
Yes, so we havenât seen the details of the budget related to spend on the type of things we produce. We are seeing an uptick in activity around some of our container product lines and there's noise elsewhere in that business as well, but the influx of orders is -- we've had steady flow, not a huge influx of orders for that business.
In terms of the mobility, the airlift business, which is the other part of our expeditionary services, that's where we're seeing noise coming out of the theater from commanders looking for support.
Shannon Burke
Okay. Great. And would those be the government funded, the government owned company operated contract?
David Storch
No. And that would be stuff that we would own and that would be in the operational budget of DOD.
Shannon Burke
Okay. Great. Okay. Thank you so much. That's all I had.
David Storch
Thank you.
Operator

Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to AAR's Fiscal Year 2017 Fourth Quarter Earnings Call. We are joined today by David Storch, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Tim Romenesko, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer; John Holmes, President and Chief Operating Officer.
Before we begin, I would like to remind you that the comments made during the call may include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as noted in our news release and the Risk Factors section of the company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2016. In providing forward-looking statements, the company assumes no obligation to provide updates to reflect future circumstances or anticipated or unanticipated events.
At this time, I would like to turn the call over to AAR's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, David Storch.
David Storch
Thank you very much and welcome everyone. Good afternoon. I hope everybodyâs having a good day and thank you for joining us today to discuss our fourth quarter and year-end fiscal year 2017 results.
As you can tell by the release early today, we had another solid quarter as diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 29% from $0.34 in the prior year to $0.44 in the current period.
Revenue was up 5.1% or 23.7 million for the quarter primarily as a result of increased sales in our Aviation Services segment to commercial customers, partially offset by the wind down of the KC-10 program, which Tim will talk a little bit further about in his comments and our Lake Charles airframe maintenance facility which weâve discussed in the past.
Weâre especially pleased with the performance of our industry-leading integrated supply chain solutions and our aircraft and parts supply activities. During the quarter, we announced significant new business wins including the $909 million fixed-price contract from the U.S. Air Force for the Landing Gear PBL.
Under the contract, we will provide total supply chain management, including purchasing, remanufacturing, distribution, and inventory control to support the Air Force requisitions received for all C-130, KC-135, and E-3 landing gear parts. Performance on the contract is on hold pending resolution of a protest filed by one of the competitors for the contract.
We were also awarded a multi-year component support contract with ASL Group, a growing European-based scheduled and charter carrier. The new contract for Power-by-the-Hour support for ASL Groupâs airlines includes component support and repair for approximately 100 passenger and cargo aircraft, including the ATR aircraft. And we identify the ATR aircraft in this respect because we also acquired a small little business from them to support ATR aircraft and weâre excited about the possibilities for that product line.
AAR will support contract with inventory purchase from ASL subsidiary, ACLAS Global, which will be incorporated into AAR's existing global supply chain network located in Belgium, Germany, and Singapore. We were also awarded a multi-year component support agreement with Viva Colombia and Viva Air Peru.
AAR will be providing full support to affiliate airlines within the Viva Latin America group including Viva Colombia, Colombiaâs first low-cost carrier, and the newly established low-cost carrier Viva Air in Peru. AAR will make inventory available from its facilities in Miami and Chicago, as well as positioning stock in Bogota, Medellin, and Lima. We are very excited to expand our presence in Latin America with this new contract.

Weâre continuing with the growth in our integrated supply chain solutions and now supporting approximately 1,400 aircraft new aircraft platforms. Weâre also continuing to expand geographically most recently opening offices in India and New Zealand that position us closer to our customers. We believe that our closer to customer business model remains a strategic advantage for the company.
Before handing the call over to Tim, I would like to take a minute to provide an update on the INL/A contract award to AAR Airlift by the U.S. State Department back in September 2016. We expect a decision by the United States Court of Federal Claims by October 21 regarding the protest and we remain favorably inclined as a result of our expectations for the outcome from this latest protest effort.
With that, Iâd like to turn the call over to Tim to discuss the financials in a bit more detail. I may have said October 30 for October 31, 2017; so apologies on that.
Tim Romenesko
Thanks, David. As David mentioned, we had a strong fourth quarter with sales of $492 million and earnings per share of $0.44 compared to $0.34 in the prior year. Sales in the quarter grew 5% driven by growth in both segments and this is despite higher sales of 32.8 million in the prior year quarter related to the wind down of the KC-10 contract and the Lake Charles facility.
Iâm going to give you the quarterly sales on the KC-10 contract that we had in fiscal '17 for your modeling. Sales in the first quarter were 38.6 million, 29.4 million in the second quarter, 24.3 million in the third quarter, and 18.3 million in the fourth quarter for a total of 110.6 million in fiscal '17. And in fiscal '18, we expect minimal KC-10 revenue.
Gross profit increased 10.3 million for the quarter in the Aviation Services segment on increased sales volumes and margins in parts supply and commercial programs. Gross profit in the Expeditionary Services segment increased 3.9 million with improved profitability across these businesses.
SG&A expenses increased in Q4 reflecting several special items including increased legal fees related to INL, acquisition diligence costs and compensation costs including some severance. These special costs were approximately 4 million in the quarter.
Consolidated net income was up 3.3 million in the quarter and our results included a $2.2 million reduction in income tax expense related to the recognition of previously reserved income tax benefits. This item helped to offset some of the increase in the SG&A expense that we experienced related to the special items.
CapEx in the quarter were $5.6 million and depreciation and amortization was $13.9 million. During the quarter, we paid dividends of 2.9 million or $0.075 per share and we repurchased 96,000 shares for 3.2 million in the quarter. And for the year, we repurchased 767,000 shares for 19.8 million.
Our average diluted share count for the quarter was 34.3 million compared to 34.2 million in the fourth quarter last year. And as David mentioned, yesterday our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $250 million of our stock.
And just a couple of comments on the full fiscal year. Our earnings per share was $1.45 compared to $1.10 in fiscal 2016, so up a healthy 32% for the year. Sales grew 4% for the fiscal year to 1.767 billion, driven by sales growth in both segments. And again, this reflects overcoming $80 million in higher sales in the prior year from KC-10 and Lake Charles.
Gross profit increased 18.4 million in the fiscal year in Aviation Services segment and 22.2 million in Expeditionary Services segment. Net debt increased 30.1 million for fiscal 2016 as we continued to make strategic investments in our business, including assets to support new multi-year supply chain management programs supporting our customers as well as for dividends and share repurchases.

So thanks again for your interest. Now Iâll turn the call back over to David.
David Storch
We completed our Board meetings this morning. Weâve had two days of productive Board meetings as you can see from some of our announcements. Iâm pleased to announce that John Holmes was elected a Board member and you should know that John is off to a very strong start as our President and Chief Operating Officer.
We also announced the hiring of Mike Milligan to be our new Chief Financial Officer. Mike will join the company on September 1. He will have tough shoes to fill with Timâs retirement but Tim will hang around for the end of the calendar year to give ample of time for him to share with Mike some of his knowledge and make the transition a little bit smoother.
So I would like to at this moment thank Tim for his 36 years of service to the company and his valued counsel. But Iâm pleased to know that he will be the company full time through the end of the year and then will stay on as a consultant into next year for the full calendar year.
So all-in-all, our company finished up with a very strong year. We go into the new year with a fair amount of momentum; feel very good about some of the skill sets that weâve developed this past year and feel good about the investments we made to fund our future growth.
With that, Iâd like to turn the call back to you folks to see if thereâs any questions you might have that we might be able to answer.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Larry Solow with CJS Securities.
Larry Solow
Great. Thanks. Really, a good quarter. Can you just give us â it looks like obviously a lot of these new supply chain contracts are really helping in the Aviation Services, even 5% growth with the KC-10 loss. Could you just tell us what the Q4 '16 was for KC-10 so we know how much sales you lost year-over-year in the quarter? Do you have that number?
David Storch
Yes, just one second. Letâs see if we can get it real quick. Itâs 41 million.
Larry Solow
Okay. So it would have been obviously much better growth. I guess a few questions around that. Your aircraft under contract in the supply chain are up almost 50% year-over-year I think. I realize thatâs only a third of Aviation Services. I know there are also some puts and takes there too. But I guess that should support a pretty good â is it fair to say â Dave, youâve sort of not given guidance for this but youâve always sort of targeted a mid-to-high single-digit top line growth in the Aviation Services. Is that a fair outlook for '18 or maybe a little backend loaded as you got to get through some â a little higher KC-10 sales earlier in the year but how do you look at that?
David Storch
Yes, I think we can say with â what we shared in the past, I think 5% to 10% range is a range weâre comfortable with.
Larry Solow
Okay. And Lake Charles, are you guys completely out of that now? Is there any residual expenses related to that or youâve sort of exited that completely?
David Storch
Yes, by the end of this quarter.
Larry Solow
Okay. And then how is the ramp up I guess at the other MRO facilities? Is that happening a little offset â a little bit of the shift ongoing too, right?
David Storch
Yes, so as you know, the summer months are weaker months from a maintenance standpoint because the airplanes are flying. But weâre setting ourselves up to have another pretty decent year for MRO and we feel we have pretty good alignment that weâre looking at in terms of customers and facilities. And weâve brought the Rockford facilities online now. Itâs doing work. It was profitable in the Q4 period and weâre kind of excited about what the prospects might be for that as well.
Larry Solow
Okay. And on the Expeditionary side, it sounds like obviously weâre all waiting for the INL decision, but outside of that I guess the Airlift, it sounds like maybe youâve lost a little bit more positions there? And then how about mobility, maybe thatâs doing a little better?

David Storch
Mobility is doing a little bit better. Airlift, youâre correct. Weâve lost some positions. But the mobility business has seen a little bit more order flow, so not where itâs been but better than recent past.
Larry Solow
Right. It seems like for a few quarters at least itâs showing a little bit â maybe a little stability there at least hopefully.
David Storch
Yes.
Larry Solow
Okay. And just for housekeeping, I know you basically had a $0.06 benefit on the lower income tax and then I know you called out this 4.1 million total which it sounds like itâs basically a bunch of nonrecurring stuff, the biggest piece being legal. And is it all related to INL or is there some other stuff in there?
David Storch
The legal is 98%. Itâs mostly related to that.
Larry Solow
Okay. And I guess obviously that could go on another quarter or two hopefully if things go your way at October 31, itâs anybodyâs guess at this point or â how long can it go on, right? I donât know if you have an answer to that.
David Storch
Weâre technically an intervener in DynCorpâs lawsuit against the U.S. government, and we will continue to spend money in that role and hopefully the process will conclude by the October 31 date. We wonât expect much in the way of legal expense after that unless Dyncorp continues to protest.
Larry Solow
Okay. And just last question, I know you put out your new authorization approval â a pretty large authorization. I realize thereâs no timeframe but it seems like youâve talked a lot â youâve through the years returned a lot of cash to shareholders. It sounds like that will continue. Do you feel more ambitious to repurchase more shares? I know youâve been a little bit slow on that front?
David Storch
No, I think weâre â the strategy is no different than itâs been. What we were looking to do was kind of replenish the authorization. We have had a $250 million authorization back in '2014 and we went to about â maybe that was '15 actually. But we went through 187 million of it. To give us the maximum flexibility, the Board thought wise to go ahead and bring it back up to the old -- to the level it was before. No change though in terms of motivation or outlook in this regard. And obviously, we donât buy shares in as a strategy, we buy shares in opportunistically as we see fit.
Larry Solow
Understood, great. I appreciate it. Thanks, Dave.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse.
Robert Spingarn
Hi, everybody.
David Storch
Hi, Rob.
Robert Spingarn
So I guess if we do the math on that that was just discussed between the tax and the SG&A, you did, I donât know, $0.49, $0.50 in the quarter. Is that about right? Tim, would that be the --
Tim Romenesko
Yes, we had â the benefit from the taxes were a little less than the after-tax impact of kind of the special.
Robert Spingarn
Yes, I was thinking like $0.06 and $0.10 for two items, something like that. Okay. So, David, if youâre running around this $0.49, $0.50 here just to get an idea of what your earnings power is if you adjust for anything in the quarter thatâs nonrecurring or maybe seasonal or what have you? If you think about the aftermarket Aviation Services as we go forward here in the various businesses, youâve already touched a little bit on supply chain and on MRO. And then if we think about Expeditionary, its run rate ex-INL, is this the right earnings power or would you say itâs a little higher, a little lower as we go forward here?
David Storch
Yes, what Iâd like to â first of all, fourth quarter is historically a strong quarter. So you have airlines getting ready to service their customers for the summer months, so you have the â shops are pretty full and the spare parts supply is pretty robust. So thatâs been a trend for the last 15, maybe 20 years here as a company. What I would like to do, Rob, is we have our Investor Day in October. Weâll be coming out with a date here pretty soon. What Iâd like to do is kind of give you â share at that point a little bit more feel for how we see the trend, if you will, in the business. Right now we feel pretty bullish on things but I just want to let a couple of time pass, let John get a little bit more ensconced in his position. And then by around October we should be able to give a little bit more color.

Robert Spingarn
Okay. Iâve asked you in the past, weâve had this â I donât want to accelerate things for you, David, but I get the impression that youâre kind of getting to that point where youâre about $0.50 a quarter even if this fourth quarter was a little bit call it seasonally strong. And itâs not an unreasonable way to think about the future maybe adjusting a bit for seasonality. Is that a fair --?
David Storch
Yes.
Robert Spingarn
Okay. While I have you here, just on the authorization, were you intending to release that during market hours today or is that supposed to come out tonight?
David Storch
We released it â when we released it we were putting together our minutes from the Board meeting and we just released it as part of the normal course of business. So we got the authorization yesterday during the day. It was something we meant to get out last night, didnât get around to it and we got it written up this morning during our session with the Board and got it out today. So we werenât thinking about after hours or before hours.
Robert Spingarn
Okay. With INL and I know you canât quantify yet until this thing is decided but weâre all thinking about it if you win it, itâs additive. Are there any negative considerations from a management perspective or bandwidth vantage point that we should take into consideration just given the significance of this contract if and win it starts to contribute?
David Storch
Not that weâve seen, nothing that is a parent but I guess I would reserve my comments on that until after the actual execution. But nothing that is a parent.
Robert Spingarn
Okay. And then the last thing I want to ask you is if we can run through the Aviation Services businesses on a more individual level, talk about maybe with some more clarity what the growth is there in each of those pieces and how you think about that at least somewhat qualitatively going forward? So whatâs driving the strength right now? Is it the supply chain contracts? Obviously youâve said that MRO right now is a little bit lighter because the aircraft are in use. How do we think about these sub businesses in 2018 from a growth perspective, revenue?
David Storch
So let me share with you how weâre thinking about the businesses because weâre really thinking about the businesses as being integrated and having an integrated solution. So as we think about our strategy, we think about these pieces and how theyâre connected to each other. And as we think about growing the company, we think about growing them in this fashion. So at this stage I would prefer to focus more around thinking of these businesses as a collective group of businesses designed to give us a powerful value proposition for our customers. And I believe that that strategy is working and I donât think at this stage it would be wise to deviate from that. So Iâd prefer to speak in terms of the businesses in their totality.
Robert Spingarn
Let me ask you this if I can, I donât want to pry but I think you said earlier â somebody said earlier Aviation Services gross should be in the 5% to 10% range if I caught that right. Are you then saying that each of the businesses should track that way or not necessarily? They could be far different within that but the aggregate is 5% to 10%?
David Storch
Yes, right. Iâm saying the aggregate is 5% to 10%. Yes, thatâs what Iâm saying.
Robert Spingarn
Okay. Can you give us a hierarchy of growth among the three these days?
Tim Romenesko
Iâm just going to keep trying but --
David Storch
So weâll drill down a little bit further at the Investor Day, so why donât we kind of wait on that until then and leave it at that.
Robert Spingarn
Okay, all right. Thank you very much.
David Storch
Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Ben Klieve from Noble Capital Markets.

Ben Klieve
All right. Thank you. A few questions for me. First, a couple on the INL award. First, correct me if Iâm wrong but is that legal decision that you expect on October 31, is that a bit later than you previously expected? I think I remember that you were looking at August or September earlier but I could be --?
David Storch
The last date was August 9. We then went out with a 8-K filing and laid out the dates between now and October 31, so there was a delay in the process and we articulated that through a way in the 8-K filing.
Ben Klieve
Got you. I just missed the K then. Okay. Thanks for that. So sticking with the INL, given the prolonged nature of the protest and multiple ongoing litigations that you guys have had to deal with, have you been able to speak ultimately with the customers you can kind of reasonably plan for the ramping of this award or have those communications been â maybe not shutdown but maybe minimized that would prevent you from kind of ramping that up pretty quickly once this is resolved?
David Storch
Shutdown.
Ben Klieve
Shutdown, okay. I guess do you anticipate then because of them, because of the way that this will maybe take another â that the ramp will take a little bit longer than youâd previously hoped?
David Storch
No. We would be hopeful that we could get on schedule on the ramp. Weâve had enough time to think about it. So weâre pretty prepared. Weâre pretty prepared.
Ben Klieve
All right. Next, I was wondering if you could provide any context around the timing of the protest on the Air Force Landing Gear awards. Do you have any visibility for that?
David Storch
We have reason to believe that a decision will be known before the month is out. So weâre hopeful that weâll hear something on that before July 31.
Ben Klieve
Perfect, very good. And then this may be a question that youâd like to discuss on your Investor Day but Iâm wondering you talked a bit about the strength in the mobility business and some weaker â a bit of softness out of the Airlift side. Iâm wondering if you can just provide a little bit of context as to what youâre seeing from both those businesses and any thoughts than can help us think about how those two businesses are going to perform in '18.
David Storch
So on the mobility, weâre seeing an increase in dialogue around opportunities with the customers, some new product development actually as well as some of the traditional products. On the Airlift, weâve won some â weâve been named on some IDIQs but we havenât won any past quarters. So weâre a little bit â weâre short there in terms of positions as we mentioned earlier in this call. So again, I think we can get into a lot deeper â more deeper dive at the October Investor Day.
Ben Klieve
Okay. Thank you. I look forward to that. And then one final question and then Iâll hop back in queue here. Back to the INL award, do you think that there is any potential for the state to add to the ceiling value on the existing contract at all, or does it seem like thatâs pretty set?
Tim Romenesko
We have no visibility on that.
Ben Klieve
Okay, very good. Thanks for taking my questions. Iâll jump back in.
David Storch
Thanks, Ben.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Ciarmoli with SunTrust.
Michael Ciarmoli
Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking my questions here. Maybe, David, just to go back to Robâs line of questioning, I know you mentioned the 5% to 10% Aviation growth and I think in the past, maybe at the last Investor Day, you guys had 5% to 10% at the company level. Obviously Aviation is growing pretty rapidly right now. Should we expect that to decelerate to that 5% to 10%? Iâm just trying to get a sense for the growth rate. Is the whole company still expected to grow 5% to 10% as well?
David Storch

Yes. Tim just laid out for you some of the headwinds we faced with the KC-10 wind down.
Michael Ciarmoli
Right. And thatâs still going to be â thatâs going to be roughly a 100 million headwind next year, correct?
David Storch
Thatâs right, yes.
Michael Ciarmoli
Okay. Just thinking about maybe the other headwind, should we expect the level of legal spend, this 4 million, to kind of sustain through next quarter? And basically if this does get resolved sooner obviously but if we donât hear anything until the end of October, is that sort of a good level of expense thatâs going to be sustained and then youâll have to absorb into the P&L?
David Storch
We would expect the legal expenses to be lower.
Michael Ciarmoli
Would be lower, okay, got it. And then just from a margin standpoint, you obviously have this KC headwind but yet the Aviation gross margin is 17.4%. How should we think about once you guys sort of absorb this wind down, is there room for further improvement in that aviation gross margin?
David Storch
We believe that thereâs room for improvement, yes. We believe as we succeed more providing integrated solutions that it not just creates more value for our customer but we also think it creates more value for our shareholders as well.
Michael Ciarmoli
And should that be â do you expect that gross margin to be flattish or expand next year just given that $100 million headwind or do you not see that as much of an impact into next year?
David Storch
I think as it relates to next year because of the item you mentioned, I think weâre expecting relatively flat.
Michael Ciarmoli
Flat, okay, got it. And then maybe just the last one for me, on the share repurchase, I know you said youâd be opportunistic. I think last time you guys did sort of a Dutch auction at â 250 million could theoretically buy maybe 17% or so of the shares outstanding. But how is the Board thinking about funding this? Are we going to see a debt offering here in the near term? I know youâve had a target leverage ratio out there or target leverage of 3.5 times. But what are the thoughts about funding this buyback?
David Storch
Yes, so first of all, we and one of the â as youâve seen me indicate, we have different â we look at the application of capital across a few different possibilities. And one of the possibilities of course is investing in the business itself. So if you look at the year that just ended, we spent money buying inventory to support some of these programs that weâve recently won. We will maintain a balanced approach based on the cash needed to fund the growth of the business and look at the cash that is available and the ratios that are available to us in terms of EBITDA to debt. Weâll keep surveying that and make determinations based on the share price, based on other uses of our capital as to when the right times to be investing in the stock. We do not expect to have a debt offering or there has been no discussion at all about a debt offering to fund the purchases of the stock. And I want to be careful in not signaling any changes from how weâve been behaving to-date just that weâre looking to refresh what we had previously authorized and giving the company some flexibility as it relates to applications of capital. So please donât be expecting anything unusual to take place.
Michael Ciarmoli
Got it. Thatâs helpful. I will jump back in the queue. Thanks, guys.

Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. We have a follow-up question from Larry Solow with CJS Securities.
Larry Solow
If I just can real quick on the profitability of the KC-10, I thought it was at least below average on the â I donât know, maybe on the gross line. So was that actually accretive to your â in other words I thought maybe losing that, sales would not be â would actually may be accretive to the relative margin I should say?

David Storch
Let me â my recollection is that itâs slightly â itâs two components to the KC-10. Thereâs the flight hour piece which is below â you may recall weâre reporting it at zero margin. And then thereâs the over and above which have a healthier margin. So my sense is that the gross profit line is probably below our blended rate.
Larry Solow
Right, okay. And then just lastly, did you give the cash flow from the operations in Q4? You gave the CapEx. I was just trying to figure out what the free cash flow was for the year? And then I guess thereâs some working capital I guess still building out inventory.
Tim Romenesko
Cash flow from operations was 33 million in Q4.
Larry Solow
Okay.
David Storch
Larry, did you get that?
Larry Solow
Yes, I got that. And then just on the outlook, obviously I think somewhat of a high class problem in terms of building inventory purchases to support these contracts, any target for free cash flow? Itâs been sort of a little bit all over the board the last few years I know.
David Storch
Yes, what Iâd like to do again here is Iâd like to have a chance â in this regard that might have to be a little later than October. I want to have a chance to see the impact of the ramp of all these different contracts, because the pace of ingestion has been pretty rapid here. And the first step for us is to make sure we can satisfy the requirements that the customer has and so weâre making the investments we feel are necessary for that. And now we have to give these programs a chance to ramp and take a look what the ongoing costs are against the revenues that come in. So Iâd prefer at this stage to give ourselves a little bit more time to see how that evolves. We have internal targets but I prefer to see how we actually perform before I comment.
Larry Solow
Okay, great. I appreciate it. Thanks.
Operator
Thank you. Speakers, Iâm showing no further questions at this time. Iâll turn the call back over to you.

And welcome to AAR's Fiscal Year 2018 First Quarter Earnings Call. We are joined today by David Storch, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; John Holmes, President and COO; Mike Milligan, Vice President and CFO and Tim Romenesko, Vice Chairman.Before we begin, I would like to remind you that the comments made during the call may include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as noted in our news release and the Risk Factors section of the Company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2017. In providing forward-looking statements, the Company assumed no obligation to provide updates to reflect future circumstances or anticipated or unanticipated events.At this time, I would like to turn the call over to AAR's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, David Storch.David StorchThank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining us here today. With me in Chicago we have, Mike Milligan, who joined the Company September 1st. Mike is our new CFO, and he'll introduce himself a little further in this presentation. Very excited to have Mike join the team and counting on great things coming from Mike in his -- as he gets familiarize himself with our industry and the Company. He's off to a good start and working very closely with Tim Romenesko. Tim, as we discussed before, also here with me in Chicago will be retiring December 31st and I can't say enough good things about Tim. He's just been a real strong force here at the Company and a great business partner to many of us here. And although he will be retiring, he will still stay engaged with the Company from [MLV] or post his retirement. Also here is John Holmes. John, as you recall, was named President and Chief Operating Officer effective June 1, and he recently joined our Board. So very strong team here, and weâll all be available to answer any questions that may come as a result of our opening comments.Now, turning back to the quarter. As you can see, we had solid first quarter. Diluted earnings per share increased nearly 11% from $0.28 last year to $0.31 in the current period. First quarter sales were up 8.5% for the quarter with sales within Aviation Services slightly above our long term target of 5% to 10% growth. The growth was even more impactful when taking into consideration the wind down of the KC-10 program, which contributed $26.9 million, less than the prior year sales.We were especially pleased with the performance of our industry leading integrated supply chain businesses. And during the quarter, we announced significant new business wins to this group of businesses, including a long-term contract awarded to us by Hawaiian Airlines to support their new Airbus neo aircraft. Weâve had a long-term and longstanding relationship with Hawaiian, and very excited to expand this relationship to support their new fleet of 18 A321neo's, a very exciting airplane for them and a very exciting program for us, get's us on to new technology Airbus platform. And we're very excited about those prospects.Weâre also awarded a long term contract to provide comprehensive flight-hour component support for 100 new Boeing 737 MAX aircraft with flydubai, which is expected to commence in October 2017. This is our second significant supply contract with flydubai. You may recall, last year, we announced the PBH program for 60 737neoâs in support of flydubai. We're very excited to grow our business with them as theyâve proven to be a successful regional carrier and the first MAX operator in the Middle East. So both of these contracts are meaningful in relationship to deepening our relationships with both of these important customers, but also meaningful in terms of providing an entrÃ©e for us to support these newest generation aircraft, which have had good successes in terms of sales rates coming both from Airbus for their version, which is the A320 family and for Boeing in their 737 family.Lastly, during the quarter, our aviation services businesses received a notice to proceed on the 15 year $900 million Landing Gear Performance-Based Logistics One program with U.S. Air Force, which we had previously announced. For this program, we're providing total supply chain management, including inventory logistics and repair services to support the Air Force requisitions received in support of all their C-130, KC-135 and E-3 landing gear requirements. And this program is expected to commence next April.Finally, earlier today, you may have seen that we announced the acquisition of two MRO businesses from premier aviation in Canada. Simultaneous with this acquisition, we announced the new long-term contract with Air Canada for airplane maintenance on their narrow-body fleet and their regional fleet of aircraft. These airframe maintenance services will be performed in our newly acquired Canadian facilities. The total value of this contract is approximately CAD500 million. This is not all incremental because we are currently doing business with Air Canada, and weâll know shortly weâll be able to communicate shortly what the impact is in terms of growth. But itâs a nice increase in business with Air Canada.And with that, I would like to turn the call over to Mike so he can give you a little bit more color on our financials. So Mike?Mike MilliganGreat, thanks David. Good afternoon everybody. Itâs a pleasure to be here today. I recently joined AAR on September 1st after more than 30-years of financial experience in both public accounting and industry. Most recently, I was a CFO of a large private equity owned equipment rental company that was purchased by the industry leader back in April. I am excited and impressed with the AAR team at all levels and feel that the Company is well positioned for growth in the future. And I look forward to working out with all of you in the coming periods.Iâll run through a few of the comments on the Company's first quarter '18 financial performance. Then we can move to Q&A. As you can see in the release, we experienced strong sales growth in the quarter, up to $439 million, up 8.5% or $34 million from the same period in the prior year. These increases were driven by strong performance of our Aviation Services segment. Sales at the Aviation Services segment increased $37 million or 11% year-over-year, and the related gross profit increased $4.4 million or 8% for the current quarter.Notwithstanding how good we feel about the results, it should be noted that the operating income was down slightly year-over-year. In this year's results, we incurred $1 million of non-recurring costs and in last year's results we recognized $2.6 million gain from the sale of a product line in expeditionary services. Normalizing our performance would show 20% increase in operating results year-over-year.Consolidated net income was up 11.5% to $10.6 million year-over-year. Our income tax was favorably impacted in the quarter by adapting new amended accounting standard for stock-based compensation. That impact was $1.2 million favorable amount. Our capital expenditures for the quarter were $8.2 million and depreciation and amortization for the same period was $14.6 million. During the quarter, we paid dividends of $2.6 million or $0.75 per share. We repurchased 142,600 shares in the quarter at $5.2 million.Our average diluted share count for the quarter was $34.5 million compared to $34.2 million in the prior year, and reflected increases of option exercises and additional grants offset by the reduction of more than 600,000 shares that were repurchased year-over-year.With that, I'll kick it back over to David.David StorchThanks Mike. And once again, welcome to the Company and great job there. Appreciate it. Iâll just end by saying, I'm sure you recall that historically first quarter is relatively soft quarter to compared to others; and that the airlines have most aircraft to flying; demand is pretty high in the summer months. And historically, this has been a softer quarter than other quarters, but still nice increase over the prior year.And I feel good about the progress weâve made during the quarter. I feel good about the acquisition that we announced this morning. But mostly, I feel really good about our leadership team and the momentum this team is generating as we come into the second quarter of our fiscal year.So with that, thanks for joining us. And weâll open it up for any questions you might have.Question-and-Answer SessionOperator[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Larry Solow.Larry SolowThanks. First off, just want to wish Tim best of luck. It's been a pleasure to work with you for last 11 yearsâ¦Tim RomeneskoThanks Larry.Larry SolowYes, absolutely. And then welcome to the Company Mike, and we look forward to continuing the relationship. But just first question, just on the Aviation Services, obviously, a really good quarter, I think it's like 20% -- 21% growth excluding the KC-10 loss, which weâre aware of. Was that program -- the programs biz and the distribution business have been growing like gain-busters as evidenced by your aircraft under contract in last year, the growth there. But did the distribution -- the trading parts business and the MRO businesses also pick up a little bit to help drive that growth. Itâs a pretty good growthâ¦Mike MilliganThe trading sales were up $22 million or 42% and the commercial programs were up over $18 million.Larry SolowSo trading obviously did have an impact. Is that bump up -- was there anything in there thatâs sort of unusual or anything orâ¦John HolmesNo. This is John Holmes. It's not unusual. Weâve had a nice recovery, I'll call it, over the last five or six quarters in the trading business. And volume, both for engine and airplane parts has actually been quite consistent over that period of time.Larry SolowAnd then with that pretty good growth and then obviously the drop off of KC-10, which was -- from my understanding, much lower margins. You did call out the $1 million in non-recurring cost. But on that, the gross margin line with just great growth still down, anything else in there mix wise or anything that was unusual or any thoughts on that?John HolmesNot anything unusual.Larry SolowSo I mean is that the step down in gross margin was that due to those onetime costs or is it just little bit of surprise that you can grow 20% outside of a business that was probably not very profitable, but yet your gross margins year-over-year came down?John HolmesYes, it was due to those onetime costs. We had some restructuring in one of our businesses that resulted in some severance. And then we also had some customer movement in our MRO business that incurred some costs as we moved transition customers from one facility to another.Larry SolowGot it. And then just last question on the purchase from Premier. Those facilities, were they -- obviously, Air Canada, youâre going to -- sounds like youâre going to bring their existing work out today plus the incremental to that facility. Are those facilities serving other customers? Is there other revenue and utilization going on there, and as the transition goes to you guys?John HolmesYes. There is existing revenue there. The two facilities -- one of the facilities is full of other customers in addition to Air Canada, which we mentioned that the Air Canada E-Jet work is being done in the one facility already today along with other customers. We plan to work with the existing customers to transition them either to the other Premier facility or other of ARR facilities as the A320 portion of the Air Canada work is pulled up.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Ben Klieve.Ben KlieveSo couple of questions for you. First of all, to building off the discussion in the MRO facilities that you described. I'm wondering what if any impact will be on your existing U.S. based facilities? Are you anticipating any shipping business from the U.S. up towards those Canadian facilities? How do you see that playing out?John HolmesNo, no. If anything, it could be the office that where we think some of the work that exists there and move it to another one of our U.S. based facilities. But nothing from the U.S. will migrate to Canada.David StorchSo this contract is not about moving and the acquisition is not about moving work or jobs outside the United States. In fact, this is purely around capturing business in the Canadian marketing and retaining business they currently do. But we're looking at this as a way to bolster our presence in the North American market, strengthen our position here in North America, which obviously is mostly U.S. based.Ben KlieveAnd then with those facilities, is the workforce thatâs there, is there any meaningful gain in representation?David StorchNo.Ben KlieveAnd you said at neither facility?John HolmesNeither facilitiesâ¦Ben KlieveAnd I guess last question on that is the timing. David, you said that there would be some more information coming out about the -- what would be incremental growth above your existing relationships. Do you guys know roughly when you think we're going to find out more about the specifics on the revenue, and when the revenue is going to begin ramping?David StorchWe should be able to share that information in a week and half or 10 days. So at the end of next week, I think, weâll have that information for you.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Michael Ciarmoli.Michael CiarmoliMaybe just to stay on that Premier. What was the rationale for us and wanting to sell those businesses, those facilities?David StorchWell, you had a private owner, a entrepreneur. He was getting to an age where heâs looking to retire and lessen his burden, if you will. The businesses were growing; and I think if the timing was right for him and it was for us and it was for Air Canada. So I think you can see there is a connection between the acquisition and the contract signing with Air Canada. And I think he was helpful in making all that happen.Michael CiarmoliWas this a competitive process, was anyone else interested, or was this more of exclusive with just you guys?David StorchI can't say that. You never know the things are 100% wise. I mean, we felt we had a good -- we've had a long standing relationship with Air Canada. Air Canada introduced us to these folks, and there may have been others. But I can't tell you that there were, or there weren't, I donât know.Michael CiarmoliAnd then just -- I think you guys also had maybe an announcement, I think it might have been late August. You got an exclusive deal with AMETEK to distribute some of their military related content. Can you just elaborate on -- I think you've got a couple of these exclusive deals on the distribution side. What are you guys bringing to the table that you're landing these contracts versus some of the other distributors out there? Why are some of these OEMs choosing you guys?David StorchThanks for the question. Growing that distribution business has been a big part of our strategy for the last few years. And we've seen a lot of lot of success in capturing exclusive distributorships, just like the AMETEK deal. I'd say the value proposition for us, relative to our two largest competitor AVL and Satair is our independence and our channels to market. So with the growth of the Power-by-the-Hour business, with the growth of the MRO business, we have a number of touch points with the customers that allow us to push the OEMâs product in a way that our competitors may not be.Michael CiarmoliAnd then just last one, I'll ask more of a bigger picture on the market; Boeing pushing for their services entrÃ©e into the services market; they've got some pretty ambitious goals. Have you guys seen anything? I mean, is there an opportunity for you guys to partner with Boeing? Is it more of a risk maybe as it relates to all the different aspects of your aviation businesses from the distribution, the integrated services supply chains? What color can you provide around what Boeing is or what you're seeing in the marketplace with Boeing?David StorchSo Boeing, of course, is a very different company than AAR. And Boeing has made some noise about looking at the in the avionics industry in a way that they haven't in the past, largely due their interest in capturing more aftermarket activity. And I believe you've seen the UTC Collins transaction. I believe that Boeing, our relationship with Boeing today, is their supplier, their customer and their competitor. They were a competitor on the flydubai transaction. And I'm sure they will win some competitions and there'll be a good competitor.But nevertheless, I think we offer speed, customer familiarization, a broader product line offering in that we can support not just your Boeing fleet but also your Airbus and Bombardier and Embraer fleet. And this is our core fundamental business. We understand and particularly around maintenance, we understand have a get aircraft in and out hangers quickly and safely. On the supply chain business, we understand how to value inventories in ways that might be a little tougher for somebody like Boeing. Plus as I indicated, we go across the different platforms and arenât Boeing centric or Airbus centric, but can really focus on the customer and their solution set. So we don't believe that their interest in the aftermarket is necessarily competitive to our interest. But time will tell. We feel good about our positioning.Michael CiarmoliLast one, INL contract. Are we still on track for October 31st, or weâd hear something sooner?David StorchOctober 31st should be the latest date and also we might hear something sooner, but should be no later. As of today, no later than October 31st.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of [Stan Mayer].Unidentified AnalystI have a question on a contract that I don't think you've mentioned, so I'd like to get some clarity on. The contract with the State Department the big contract, is that going to start in this fiscal?David StorchYes. So Stan, the last question was around the INL contract, which is the state department contract. It is under a -- still under a protest. The first protest we succeeded at the GAO level, the encumbence then perceived through the U.S. government on their decision at the Court of Federal Claims. The case is currently at the Court of Federal Claims. And they will be decision rendered on October 31, or sooner. But we have not begun work. We are hopeful that the decision will be in our favor as all the previous decisions have been. And that we would be receive and know this to commence work shortly thereafter.Unidentified AnalystSo still in the pipelineâ¦David StorchYes.Unidentified AnalystUse of cash, David. Can you give us your priorities for kind of prioritiesâ¦David StorchSo Stan, similar to the past, weâre very focused on growing the business. So we're investing in the business. We discussed in this call couple of contracts, the flydubai contract and the Hawaiian contract, as well as youâve followed the Company over the years, other contracts, we've recently received in supporting the inventory needs of airlines around the world. And these contracts have appeared where they require investment. And so we get -- start taking cash flows in return. We will continue to look for ways as we have with this acquisition of Premier to enhance the Company, enhance our value proposition. And under the belief that we're strengthening our product offering in a way that makes us more valuable over time.So our first priority remains investing in the business -- and then weâll look for ways to get capital back to our shareholders as weâve also demonstrated over the last three to four years. So we've given back through share repurchase and dividends about $250 million. And we have a recent reauthorization -- share repurchase authorization, I should say by the Board that refreshed our last authorization, which was $250 million worth of our stock. And we will, from time-to-time, be returning capital in that fashion.Unidentified AnalystYour cash flow with the premier -- you're currently using your full cash flow, but not liquidity?David StorchYes. So our liquidity is -- we have a healthy liquidity position in excess of $300 million, and weâll be financing the premier transaction with a specific piece of Canadian dollar based financing. And so our liquidity remained strong. We are investing in the business on Q1. We were a net investor, a net consumer of cash, I should say. And we would expect that through the balance of the year weâll be a net generator of cash.Unidentified AnalystLast question and probably may have no impact on you at all, but the United Tech Rockwell Collins acquisition. How does that change either your planning, your strategy, your priorities? What affect will it have on AIR, if any?David StorchSo we're very cognizant on the transaction. We do business with both Unite Technologies and Collins. We donât anticipate that those relationships -- we're not anticipating any change in relationship. Weâre a little bit tighter with UT than we would be with Collins. So if anything, hopefully, the UT management will encourage Collins to do more business with us. So as we sit here today, we view it neutral to potentially positive.Unidentified AnalystCollins was your father-in- laws first account?David StorchYes, it was trueâ¦Unidentified AnalystEverything goes in circles. Anyway, thank you. Good job.OperatorThere are no further questions at this time.David StorchOkay. Well, thank you so much for your participation today. Hopefully, you're pleased with the results as we are. And look forward to the next time we convene. Thank you.OperatorThis concludes today's conference call.

Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. And welcome to AAR's Fiscal Year 2018 First Quarter Earnings Call. We are joined today by David Storch, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; John Holmes, President and COO; Mike Milligan, Vice President and CFO and Tim Romenesko, Vice Chairman.
Before we begin, I would like to remind you that the comments made during the call may include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as noted in our news release and the Risk Factors section of the Company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2017. In providing forward-looking statements, the Company assumed no obligation to provide updates to reflect future circumstances or anticipated or unanticipated events.
At this time, I would like to turn the call over to AAR's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, David Storch.
David Storch
Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining us here today. With me in Chicago we have, Mike Milligan, who joined the Company September 1st. Mike is our new CFO, and he'll introduce himself a little further in this presentation. Very excited to have Mike join the team and counting on great things coming from Mike in his -- as he gets familiarize himself with our industry and the Company. He's off to a good start and working very closely with Tim Romenesko. Tim, as we discussed before, also here with me in Chicago will be retiring December 31st and I can't say enough good things about Tim. He's just been a real strong force here at the Company and a great business partner to many of us here. And although he will be retiring, he will still stay engaged with the Company from [MLV] or post his retirement. Also here is John Holmes. John, as you recall, was named President and Chief Operating Officer effective June 1, and he recently joined our Board. So very strong team here, and weâll all be available to answer any questions that may come as a result of our opening comments.
Now, turning back to the quarter. As you can see, we had solid first quarter. Diluted earnings per share increased nearly 11% from $0.28 last year to $0.31 in the current period. First quarter sales were up 8.5% for the quarter with sales within Aviation Services slightly above our long term target of 5% to 10% growth. The growth was even more impactful when taking into consideration the wind down of the KC-10 program, which contributed $26.9 million, less than the prior year sales.
We were especially pleased with the performance of our industry leading integrated supply chain businesses. And during the quarter, we announced significant new business wins to this group of businesses, including a long-term contract awarded to us by Hawaiian Airlines to support their new Airbus neo aircraft. Weâve had a long-term and longstanding relationship with Hawaiian, and very excited to expand this relationship to support their new fleet of 18 A321neo's, a very exciting airplane for them and a very exciting program for us, get's us on to new technology Airbus platform. And we're very excited about those prospects.
Weâre also awarded a long term contract to provide comprehensive flight-hour component support for 100 new Boeing 737 MAX aircraft with flydubai, which is expected to commence in October 2017. This is our second significant supply contract with flydubai. You may recall, last year, we announced the PBH program for 60 737neoâs in support of flydubai. We're very excited to grow our business with them as theyâve proven to be a successful regional carrier and the first MAX operator in the Middle East. So both of these contracts are meaningful in relationship to deepening our relationships with both of these important customers, but also meaningful in terms of providing an entrÃ©e for us to support these newest generation aircraft, which have had good successes in terms of sales rates coming both from Airbus for their version, which is the A320 family and for Boeing in their 737 family.

Lastly, during the quarter, our aviation services businesses received a notice to proceed on the 15 year $900 million Landing Gear Performance-Based Logistics One program with U.S. Air Force, which we had previously announced. For this program, we're providing total supply chain management, including inventory logistics and repair services to support the Air Force requisitions received in support of all their C-130, KC-135 and E-3 landing gear requirements. And this program is expected to commence next April.
Finally, earlier today, you may have seen that we announced the acquisition of two MRO businesses from premier aviation in Canada. Simultaneous with this acquisition, we announced the new long-term contract with Air Canada for airplane maintenance on their narrow-body fleet and their regional fleet of aircraft. These airframe maintenance services will be performed in our newly acquired Canadian facilities. The total value of this contract is approximately CAD500 million. This is not all incremental because we are currently doing business with Air Canada, and weâll know shortly weâll be able to communicate shortly what the impact is in terms of growth. But itâs a nice increase in business with Air Canada.
And with that, I would like to turn the call over to Mike so he can give you a little bit more color on our financials. So Mike?
Mike Milligan
Great, thanks David. Good afternoon everybody. Itâs a pleasure to be here today. I recently joined AAR on September 1st after more than 30-years of financial experience in both public accounting and industry. Most recently, I was a CFO of a large private equity owned equipment rental company that was purchased by the industry leader back in April. I am excited and impressed with the AAR team at all levels and feel that the Company is well positioned for growth in the future. And I look forward to working out with all of you in the coming periods.
Iâll run through a few of the comments on the Company's first quarter '18 financial performance. Then we can move to Q&A. As you can see in the release, we experienced strong sales growth in the quarter, up to $439 million, up 8.5% or $34 million from the same period in the prior year. These increases were driven by strong performance of our Aviation Services segment. Sales at the Aviation Services segment increased $37 million or 11% year-over-year, and the related gross profit increased $4.4 million or 8% for the current quarter.
Notwithstanding how good we feel about the results, it should be noted that the operating income was down slightly year-over-year. In this year's results, we incurred $1 million of non-recurring costs and in last year's results we recognized $2.6 million gain from the sale of a product line in expeditionary services. Normalizing our performance would show 20% increase in operating results year-over-year.
Consolidated net income was up 11.5% to $10.6 million year-over-year. Our income tax was favorably impacted in the quarter by adapting new amended accounting standard for stock-based compensation. That impact was $1.2 million favorable amount. Our capital expenditures for the quarter were $8.2 million and depreciation and amortization for the same period was $14.6 million. During the quarter, we paid dividends of $2.6 million or $0.75 per share. We repurchased 142,600 shares in the quarter at $5.2 million.
Our average diluted share count for the quarter was $34.5 million compared to $34.2 million in the prior year, and reflected increases of option exercises and additional grants offset by the reduction of more than 600,000 shares that were repurchased year-over-year.
With that, I'll kick it back over to David.
David Storch
Thanks Mike. And once again, welcome to the Company and great job there. Appreciate it. Iâll just end by saying, I'm sure you recall that historically first quarter is relatively soft quarter to compared to others; and that the airlines have most aircraft to flying; demand is pretty high in the summer months. And historically, this has been a softer quarter than other quarters, but still nice increase over the prior year.

And I feel good about the progress weâve made during the quarter. I feel good about the acquisition that we announced this morning. But mostly, I feel really good about our leadership team and the momentum this team is generating as we come into the second quarter of our fiscal year.
So with that, thanks for joining us. And weâll open it up for any questions you might have.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Larry Solow.
Larry Solow
Thanks. First off, just want to wish Tim best of luck. It's been a pleasure to work with you for last 11 yearsâ¦
Tim Romenesko
Thanks Larry.
Larry Solow
Yes, absolutely. And then welcome to the Company Mike, and we look forward to continuing the relationship. But just first question, just on the Aviation Services, obviously, a really good quarter, I think it's like 20% -- 21% growth excluding the KC-10 loss, which weâre aware of. Was that program -- the programs biz and the distribution business have been growing like gain-busters as evidenced by your aircraft under contract in last year, the growth there. But did the distribution -- the trading parts business and the MRO businesses also pick up a little bit to help drive that growth. Itâs a pretty good growthâ¦
Mike Milligan
The trading sales were up $22 million or 42% and the commercial programs were up over $18 million.
Larry Solow
So trading obviously did have an impact. Is that bump up -- was there anything in there thatâs sort of unusual or anything orâ¦
John Holmes
No. This is John Holmes. It's not unusual. Weâve had a nice recovery, I'll call it, over the last five or six quarters in the trading business. And volume, both for engine and airplane parts has actually been quite consistent over that period of time.
Larry Solow
And then with that pretty good growth and then obviously the drop off of KC-10, which was -- from my understanding, much lower margins. You did call out the $1 million in non-recurring cost. But on that, the gross margin line with just great growth still down, anything else in there mix wise or anything that was unusual or any thoughts on that?
John Holmes
Not anything unusual.
Larry Solow
So I mean is that the step down in gross margin was that due to those onetime costs or is it just little bit of surprise that you can grow 20% outside of a business that was probably not very profitable, but yet your gross margins year-over-year came down?
John Holmes
Yes, it was due to those onetime costs. We had some restructuring in one of our businesses that resulted in some severance. And then we also had some customer movement in our MRO business that incurred some costs as we moved transition customers from one facility to another.
Larry Solow
Got it. And then just last question on the purchase from Premier. Those facilities, were they -- obviously, Air Canada, youâre going to -- sounds like youâre going to bring their existing work out today plus the incremental to that facility. Are those facilities serving other customers? Is there other revenue and utilization going on there, and as the transition goes to you guys?
John Holmes
Yes. There is existing revenue there. The two facilities -- one of the facilities is full of other customers in addition to Air Canada, which we mentioned that the Air Canada E-Jet work is being done in the one facility already today along with other customers. We plan to work with the existing customers to transition them either to the other Premier facility or other of ARR facilities as the A320 portion of the Air Canada work is pulled up.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Ben Klieve.
Ben Klieve
So couple of questions for you. First of all, to building off the discussion in the MRO facilities that you described. I'm wondering what if any impact will be on your existing U.S. based facilities? Are you anticipating any shipping business from the U.S. up towards those Canadian facilities? How do you see that playing out?

John Holmes
No, no. If anything, it could be the office that where we think some of the work that exists there and move it to another one of our U.S. based facilities. But nothing from the U.S. will migrate to Canada.
David Storch
So this contract is not about moving and the acquisition is not about moving work or jobs outside the United States. In fact, this is purely around capturing business in the Canadian marketing and retaining business they currently do. But we're looking at this as a way to bolster our presence in the North American market, strengthen our position here in North America, which obviously is mostly U.S. based.
Ben Klieve
And then with those facilities, is the workforce thatâs there, is there any meaningful gain in representation?
David Storch
No.
Ben Klieve
And you said at neither facility?
John Holmes
Neither facilitiesâ¦
Ben Klieve
And I guess last question on that is the timing. David, you said that there would be some more information coming out about the -- what would be incremental growth above your existing relationships. Do you guys know roughly when you think we're going to find out more about the specifics on the revenue, and when the revenue is going to begin ramping?
David Storch
We should be able to share that information in a week and half or 10 days. So at the end of next week, I think, weâll have that information for you.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Michael Ciarmoli.
Michael Ciarmoli
Maybe just to stay on that Premier. What was the rationale for us and wanting to sell those businesses, those facilities?
David Storch
Well, you had a private owner, a entrepreneur. He was getting to an age where heâs looking to retire and lessen his burden, if you will. The businesses were growing; and I think if the timing was right for him and it was for us and it was for Air Canada. So I think you can see there is a connection between the acquisition and the contract signing with Air Canada. And I think he was helpful in making all that happen.
Michael Ciarmoli
Was this a competitive process, was anyone else interested, or was this more of exclusive with just you guys?
David Storch
I can't say that. You never know the things are 100% wise. I mean, we felt we had a good -- we've had a long standing relationship with Air Canada. Air Canada introduced us to these folks, and there may have been others. But I can't tell you that there were, or there weren't, I donât know.
Michael Ciarmoli
And then just -- I think you guys also had maybe an announcement, I think it might have been late August. You got an exclusive deal with AMETEK to distribute some of their military related content. Can you just elaborate on -- I think you've got a couple of these exclusive deals on the distribution side. What are you guys bringing to the table that you're landing these contracts versus some of the other distributors out there? Why are some of these OEMs choosing you guys?
David Storch
Thanks for the question. Growing that distribution business has been a big part of our strategy for the last few years. And we've seen a lot of lot of success in capturing exclusive distributorships, just like the AMETEK deal. I'd say the value proposition for us, relative to our two largest competitor AVL and Satair is our independence and our channels to market. So with the growth of the Power-by-the-Hour business, with the growth of the MRO business, we have a number of touch points with the customers that allow us to push the OEMâs product in a way that our competitors may not be.
Michael Ciarmoli
And then just last one, I'll ask more of a bigger picture on the market; Boeing pushing for their services entrÃ©e into the services market; they've got some pretty ambitious goals. Have you guys seen anything? I mean, is there an opportunity for you guys to partner with Boeing? Is it more of a risk maybe as it relates to all the different aspects of your aviation businesses from the distribution, the integrated services supply chains? What color can you provide around what Boeing is or what you're seeing in the marketplace with Boeing?

David Storch
So Boeing, of course, is a very different company than AAR. And Boeing has made some noise about looking at the in the avionics industry in a way that they haven't in the past, largely due their interest in capturing more aftermarket activity. And I believe you've seen the UTC Collins transaction. I believe that Boeing, our relationship with Boeing today, is their supplier, their customer and their competitor. They were a competitor on the flydubai transaction. And I'm sure they will win some competitions and there'll be a good competitor.
But nevertheless, I think we offer speed, customer familiarization, a broader product line offering in that we can support not just your Boeing fleet but also your Airbus and Bombardier and Embraer fleet. And this is our core fundamental business. We understand and particularly around maintenance, we understand have a get aircraft in and out hangers quickly and safely. On the supply chain business, we understand how to value inventories in ways that might be a little tougher for somebody like Boeing. Plus as I indicated, we go across the different platforms and arenât Boeing centric or Airbus centric, but can really focus on the customer and their solution set. So we don't believe that their interest in the aftermarket is necessarily competitive to our interest. But time will tell. We feel good about our positioning.
Michael Ciarmoli
Last one, INL contract. Are we still on track for October 31st, or weâd hear something sooner?
David Storch
October 31st should be the latest date and also we might hear something sooner, but should be no later. As of today, no later than October 31st.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of [Stan Mayer].
Unidentified Analyst
I have a question on a contract that I don't think you've mentioned, so I'd like to get some clarity on. The contract with the State Department the big contract, is that going to start in this fiscal?
David Storch
Yes. So Stan, the last question was around the INL contract, which is the state department contract. It is under a -- still under a protest. The first protest we succeeded at the GAO level, the encumbence then perceived through the U.S. government on their decision at the Court of Federal Claims. The case is currently at the Court of Federal Claims. And they will be decision rendered on October 31, or sooner. But we have not begun work. We are hopeful that the decision will be in our favor as all the previous decisions have been. And that we would be receive and know this to commence work shortly thereafter.
Unidentified Analyst
So still in the pipelineâ¦
David Storch
Yes.
Unidentified Analyst
Use of cash, David. Can you give us your priorities for kind of prioritiesâ¦
David Storch
So Stan, similar to the past, weâre very focused on growing the business. So we're investing in the business. We discussed in this call couple of contracts, the flydubai contract and the Hawaiian contract, as well as youâve followed the Company over the years, other contracts, we've recently received in supporting the inventory needs of airlines around the world. And these contracts have appeared where they require investment. And so we get -- start taking cash flows in return. We will continue to look for ways as we have with this acquisition of Premier to enhance the Company, enhance our value proposition. And under the belief that we're strengthening our product offering in a way that makes us more valuable over time.
So our first priority remains investing in the business -- and then weâll look for ways to get capital back to our shareholders as weâve also demonstrated over the last three to four years. So we've given back through share repurchase and dividends about $250 million. And we have a recent reauthorization -- share repurchase authorization, I should say by the Board that refreshed our last authorization, which was $250 million worth of our stock. And we will, from time-to-time, be returning capital in that fashion.

Unidentified Analyst
Your cash flow with the premier -- you're currently using your full cash flow, but not liquidity?
David Storch
Yes. So our liquidity is -- we have a healthy liquidity position in excess of $300 million, and weâll be financing the premier transaction with a specific piece of Canadian dollar based financing. And so our liquidity remained strong. We are investing in the business on Q1. We were a net investor, a net consumer of cash, I should say. And we would expect that through the balance of the year weâll be a net generator of cash.
Unidentified Analyst
Last question and probably may have no impact on you at all, but the United Tech Rockwell Collins acquisition. How does that change either your planning, your strategy, your priorities? What affect will it have on AIR, if any?
David Storch
So we're very cognizant on the transaction. We do business with both Unite Technologies and Collins. We donât anticipate that those relationships -- we're not anticipating any change in relationship. Weâre a little bit tighter with UT than we would be with Collins. So if anything, hopefully, the UT management will encourage Collins to do more business with us. So as we sit here today, we view it neutral to potentially positive.
Unidentified Analyst
Collins was your father-in- laws first account?
David Storch
Yes, it was trueâ¦
Unidentified Analyst
Everything goes in circles. Anyway, thank you. Good job.
Operator
There are no further questions at this time.
David Storch
Okay. Well, thank you so much for your participation today. Hopefully, you're pleased with the results as we are. And look forward to the next time we convene. Thank you.

We are joined today by David Storch, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; John Holmes, President and COO; and Mike Milligan, Vice President and CFO.Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that the comments made during the call may include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as noted in our news release and the Risk Factors section of the company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2017. In providing forward-looking statements, the company assumes no obligation to provide updates to reflect future circumstances or anticipated or unanticipated events. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to ARR's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, David Storch.David StorchThank you, and good afternoon all. Let me start by wishing everyone a very happy holiday season, and a great new year. Q2, as you can see, was a solid quarter for the company as we increased sales and profitability on all of our Aviation Services businesses, began work on the INL/A contract and made solid investments that will support growth into the future.We continue to gain momentum in our program business, and I'm exceptionally pleased with the progress that the recently added team has made. I'm also pleased with the opportunistic buys made by our trading team as we benefited from aircraft movement. We have unquestionably the best trading team in the industry. We expanded our MRO network with the acquisition of 2 facilities in Canada that allows us to grow our relationship with Air Canada and others.In the Expeditionary services segment, we are very excited to have begun work on the INL/A contract. We are off to a great start. Also in this segment, certain key contracts for USTRANSCOM rolled off as expected. Given where the opportunity is for us today, we are shifting resources and repositioning talent to focus on what is generally referred to as the government-owned, government -- contractor operated, or GOCO, service model. As many of you know, the helicopter market has been under pressure the last 3 to 4 years, requiring us to take the impairment action we took. Our plan is to sell some of the assets and deploy some of the -- redeploy some of the assets as markets dictate.So with that, what I'd like to do this call to -- turn the call over to John. John will be followed by Mike, and I'll wrap up the commentary before we open for questions and answers.John HolmesGreat. Thanks, David. Good afternoon, everybody. As David mentioned, our Aviation Services segment performed very well during the quarter with a sales increase of 13% and $346.7 million to $391.6 million. Gross profit margin in this segment also increased from 16% in the prior year's quarter to 17% in the current year.I'm exceptionally pleased with our sales growth to commercial customers which came in at 20%, as we benefited from the successful ramp of our program contract, growth in our part supply businesses and expansion of our MRO network. During the quarter, we announced a few new business wins as well. They included 2 contracts that we signed for heavy maintenance services with Air Canada. One of those was a 5-year contract covering their 767 Suite, and that's work that we are going to be performing down at our Miami facility.We signed a second contract also with Air Canada, 10-year deal covering Air Canada's A320 family and E-190 fleet. This work is being performed at our newly acquired Canadian facilities, and I should mention that the integration of those facilities are actually going very well, and we've already delivered several aircraft on time to Air Canada under this contract. We were also awarded -- also an MRO, a long term contract with Republic airline to perform heavy maintenance on its fleet of 188 Embraer 170 and 175 aircraft. And I am sure most of you know they're a co-share partner to United American and Delta supporting their operations with that fleet.As many on you know, the government markets as David mentioned in support of troop movements continue to be soft. And as a result, we have experienced decreased positions in our company-owned, company-operated, or what is generally known as COCO business, over the last few years. As David mentioned, we are excited to begin work on the WASS program, and are taking action to reposition our resources in order to focus on more contracts like WASS, where we operate government-owned assets. As David indicated, this business is generally known as government-owned, contractor-operated services, or GOCO, and we plan to pursue more contracts of this nature going forward.With that, I'd like to turn it over to Mike Milligan, who will talk about the financial results in more detail.Michael MilliganThanks, John. Good afternoon, everybody. I'll discuss the company's Q2 fiscal '18 financial performance in more detail. We experienced increased sales in the quarter of $449.7 million, up 6% or $25.9 million from the same period in the prior year. Our sales growth was driven by strong performance in our Aviation Services segment. Sales at Aviation Services increased $45 million or 13% year-over-year. The $391.6 million from sales growth in integrated solutions, including supply chain, MRO services and parts and supply -- parts supply, which more than offset the reduced year-over-year sales from the KC-10 contract of $20 million.We experienced the sales decline in Expeditionary Services as indicated in the release. Gross profit in Aviation Services increased $10 million to $66 million in the quarter from operating gains in maintenance services, trading and distribution. While the gross profit in Expeditionary Services was negatively impacted by the noncash impairment charges and the contract completions in the period.SG&A expense of $54.8 million included $4 million of the noncash impairment charge, increased legal costs related to the INL/A, contract defense and deal related costs. Excluding these costs, SG&A expenses were more than 11% of sales. We have historically been in the 10% range for these costs compared to sales. We'll share our plans of reverting to the historical levels in our Investor Day presentation in January.Our consolidated reported net loss was $22.6 million or $0.66 per share in the quarter, which included the impact of the $34.7 million after-tax impairment charge. This noncash impairment charge represents the effect of the write-down of certain aircraft and related support parts. As reported, our adjusted net income was $12.1 million or $0.35 per share, which included operating losses of $1.6 million or $0.03 per share in Expeditionary Services as we indicated.Capital expenditures for the quarter were $9.7 million and depreciation, amortization was $13.9 million. During the quarter, we paid dividends of $2.6 million or $0.075 per share. As of November 30, $245 million remains available under the board-authorized share repurchasing plan.Thanks for your time. And I'll let David wrap up our prepared remarks.David StorchThanks, Mike, and thanks, John, from before. During the quarter, we continued to execute on our strategy to become the best, independent aviation service provider in the world. I am very excited about our progress, investments we've made, the team in place and the favorable markets. And in closing, for those of you who may not know, there was a tax code changed recently passed, and we preliminarily estimate that the positive -- the impact on our company's fiscal '19 results will be somewhere in the range of $0.35 to $0.45 per share as a result of the change in tax rate.We'll provide more detail for our fiscal '19 plan at our Investor Day in January. So thanks, so much for participating, and I look forward to any questions that you might have.Question-and-Answer SessionOperator[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Ken Herbert.Kenneth HerbertDavid or John, really nice growth in Aviation Services. And you specifically called out, obviously, some of the heavy MRO and programs business. Can you provide just any more granularity how much of the growth in the Aviation Services in particular was MRO? And specifically, the incremental work with Air Canada and the facilities you've taken on versus maybe organic growth that you saw in programs and on the parts side?David StorchKen, most of that growth is organic. There was approximately, if you look at the net level, about 3% came through acquisitions in that segment. But largely, it's -- it would be organic growth.Kenneth HerbertOkay, okay. That's great. And then within that, can you just update us on sort of how the flydubai contract is going and the opportunity to expand that work as that airline obviously continues to take deliveries of Max aircraft in particular?John HolmesYes, thanks for asking about that. The contract is going well. We're live on -- there are two contracts the NG contract and the MAX contract. We're live on both. And we expect that our contract will be extended to cover the additional aircraft that they just ordered.Kenneth HerbertOkay, great. And just finally, can you provide an update on what you view now as the fiscal '18 contribution from INL's specifically, now that, that's obviously kicked off and up and running?David StorchOkay, I think we'll be in a better position to discuss that at the Investor Day. We're -- it really early innings -- you know, like top of the first, I guess, in Ireland. So why don't you give us a little bit more time on that?Kenneth HerbertOkay. Got it. So you're throwing out the first pitch, but I guess it's fair to say it's starting off as expected?David StorchYes, yes. We're very pleased. And I believe, State department is very pleased as well. And we've seen that we've put a great team on the field.OperatorOur next question comes from Larry Solow.Lawrence SolowJust sticking with the INL tune, I know you don't want to get too deep into the weeds there. But is it fair that, I guess, during the ramp-up period, it should be pretty much a breakeven for you guys? Is that how we should view that?David StorchWell, I would view is -- I'd view the contribution, the ramp is modest.Lawrence SolowOkay, okay. Fair enough. But I think there's a -- right? It's -- you're paid on cost right, they're refunding you that, right? So it's not a -- okay. And then just on the -- expeditionary, and then we'll go back into Aviation services. Was -- if it's excluding INL, which obviously is going to change the numbers a lot. And maybe it'll be in both segments. I don't know if that's been worked out yet. But the profit level this quarter, was it -- was there actually some gross profit, excluding the charges? And is this sort of the level that we should continue now that Afghanistan is out of there? Or is there -- was it in part of the quarter? Was there other things declining?David StorchLarry, I think we're trying to indicate where our thinking is, right? In terms of where we're taking that business. I think you can see that, hopefully. And we'll be in a better position to comment, as I indicated, at the January Investor Day.Lawrence SolowOkay. Just high-level, obviously, you know this is the -- the INL, big contract and towards your strategy of the GOCO, other -- significantly other opportunities out there? Maybe not of this size -- not of this magnitude? And does the contract win, I guess, help you open more doors for you and get other opportunities?David StorchWe believe so. Yes, yes. We believe so.Lawrence SolowOkay. Aviation services...David StorchYes, go ahead.Lawrence SolowJust get a little better feel for the growth in Aviation Services. It sounds like it's pretty broad based. The MRO and the trading business is obviously have -- haven't had the type of growth that programs and distribution have. And I am probably guessing, they probably weren't quite as high this quarter either. But fair to say programs and distribution still driving the better portion of the growth? And then, part 2 of that question is the margin improvement, anything behind that? Timing? Mix? Sustainability?David StorchYes, for the first question, in this quarter, we saw growth across the board. So the trading business, the distribution business, MRO and programs all contributed. So everybody had a good quarter. And can you repeat your second -- second half of your question?Lawrence SolowJust on the gross margin. You had a nice improvement in gross margin. I think MRO is actually -- generally has a maybe a little bit of a lower margin too, historically. So just trying to get a little pulse on the improvement. Was it just a mix? And is it a sustainable type of improvement? And what you're think of going forward?John HolmesIt was a mix. And each of the business, as I would say, showed a little improvement in the gross margin. So similar to sales, we saw growth across the -- improvement across the board there. And we do believe it's sustainable.OperatorOur next question comes from Michael Ciarmoli.Unidentified AnalystThis is actually Les [ph] in for Michael. Quick question on the $0.35 to $0.45 tailwind to tax. Can you walk us through how you get there? Somewhat of a bridge. And also, how you handle the deferred tax assets and liabilities?Michael MilliganWell, we basically are moving our effective tax rate in line with our estimates of where we think that'll be. The deferred taxes, we did not make an adjustment for that in that estimate, but we'll recognize that as we go forward in next year.Unidentified AnalystOkay, got it. And then also, there's significant appointment of the Chief Digital Officer, can you kind of talk us through how this business is going? How it's evolving over the long-term? And where do you see the aftermarket services going?Michael MilliganSo as it relates to digital, there's a couple of ways to think about that. We're excited to get Andrew on the team. He is already -- we're already learning a lot from him. We're thinking about digital across the whole company. And it will impact different areas of the business in different ways. We're looking at it from really two standpoints. One is a refresh of the way our systems work and the way our people interact with those systems to get them more efficient. And the second is using digital data analysis, et cetera, to drive traditional -- to drive sales of our traditional businesses. So we've got a number of efforts underway to be more robust in terms of how we collect and analyze data to do better price thing and ultimately, capture more market share.Unidentified AnalystGot it. And then I guess last one, on the general update on the industry trends, and as far as shop business expectations for 2018, any comment there?Michael MilliganI mean in general, we see positive trends in terms of inputs.Unidentified AnalystI'd say, year-over-year, in 2018 would you expect it to be a stronger year than 2017?Michael MilliganI think we'll talk about that a bit more in detail in January.OperatorOur next question comes from Ben Klieve.Benjamin KlieveSo first a couple, just kind of bookkeeping questions here. I had -- the KC-10 program in Q2 last year, I had $29.4 million as revenue. But, Mike, you said $20 million today. Is there...Michael MilliganYou're right. It was $29.4 million. It's down to $9.3 million. It's down $20 million.Benjamin KlieveIt's down. Got you. Okay, I apologize.David StorchThere still some revenue coming in. And so the difference is down $20 million.Benjamin KlieveRight. Got it, okay. And then, another question regarding the Air Force Landing Gear Award, are you able to quantify the revenue contribution during the second quarter from that award?Michael MilliganNo.David StorchYes, we can quantify. There was none.Michael MilliganYes.Benjamin KlieveNone? Okay. But the ramp of that contract is still, it's still on course? There is no issues with that contract so far? Everything is going all right?Michael MilliganYes, you're correct. It's ramping up or it will ramp up as expected and we'll start seeing contribution in the Q4 time period.Benjamin KlieveAnd so the announcement you made of, Andrew Kemmetmueller, I think it's really interesting. Looking forward to hearing more about that going forward here. One question I have is, before you brought him on last week, what do you really feel was lacking in your digital presence before? I know you talked a bit about that, but I mean, what really drove the creation of this position? What was the big gap that you felt needed to be addressed?David StorchI don't know if I'd characterize it as a big gap. We felt that we have an IT organization in the company that we've had for a long time. And then the digital services group is about 18 months old. And they were really existing separately. What Andrew's skill sets brings to us is the ability to have both of those organizations inside the company report to one person, because there's a lot of overlapping efforts. And we're looking to him to coordinate that. We -- at the MRO conference over in London a few months back, we launched a few of our new digital services. We got a part store, so we're selling parts online. We got some portals that we put out to help our program customers. And Andrew has got a whole pipeline of ideas that we'll continue to add in that portfolio of digital products. So bringing the digital team, the IT -- the traditional IT team together and continuing to come up with new ideas for digital innovation is what we're looking for from Andrew.Benjamin KlieveGot you. That's very interesting. Last question for me and I'll jump back in queue here is the announcement with the Republic Airline, was that a -- is that a completely brand-new relationship or was that an expansion of an existing relationship?John HolmesIt's a new heavy maintenance relationship. We've had a relationship with Republic for some time.OperatorOur next question comes from Josh Sullivan.Joshua SullivanJust on the Aviation Service side, as you're doing your forecasting for the next year, you look at the power by the hour opportunities out there. Is there any way to quantify maybe what's in the pipeline? Just trying to get an idea if there is more airlines out there looking for new suppliers, just given some of the advancements, the technology and the digital offering that you're putting out there.Michael MilliganIt's a pretty mature product at this point. We continue to see a robust opportunity pipeline. And we can talk a bit about more about the number of opportunities at the January conference.Joshua SullivanOkay, great. And I guess, can you help us with any of the dynamics maybe around the wide-body MRO service work? Are you seeing any supporting trends possibly moving work back to North America? Is it your Rockford facility maybe built around that trend? You see any interest in that facility at this point?John HolmesYes, we continue to have interest in Rockford. We're doing work for 3 different customers up there right now. The big focus for us, in the MRO facility is attracting talent, technicians. And we are starting to see some pressure in certain markets on wages.OperatorOur next question comes from Brad Evans [ph].Unidentified AnalystJust a question on bookkeeping item actually. Is -- was there -- there was reference to a $4 million impact to the SG&A line. And I am just -- I want to confirm that -- is that accurate and is that reflected in the $52.2 million ex-impairment SG&A line?Michael MilliganYes, there's 50 -- exactly. There is incremental $4 million in there, which included the SG&A piece and incremental legal and deal related costs.Unidentified AnalystWhich will be considered non-recurring going forward?Michael MilliganYes, that's right.Unidentified AnalystAnd where we should tax like that it say 34%, 35%. So that's about $0.08 hit to the $0.35 set number that you reported as adjusted?David StorchIt sounds right.Unidentified AnalystOkay. So really true earnings power in the quarter is closer to the $0.43 than the $0.35, correct? If one were to...David StorchIf you backed out the exceptional items, it is correct.OperatorOur next question comes from Larry Solow.Lawrence SolowJust to confirm on Brad's question, didn't you already -- you already I thought backed out a portion of that, right? The $2.6 million impairment. So it's only the $1 million, right? When you restate while you're backing out the entire $54.2 million charge, right? Included in that was $2.6 million in SG&A, right? So you adjusted for that already in your $0.35, if I am not mistaken? You only thing you didn't adjust for as the $1 million in legal fees, but the other portion of it unless I'm mistaken. Hello?David StorchSo the answer to the run rate -- so what you say is we would add another $0.03 to the $0.38 or $0.41.Lawrence Solow$0.38 or $0.35?David Storch$0.38. So you got the $0.35, the $0.03 what we're indicating is the losses at the business. And another $0.03 on top of that for the one-off exceptionals in the SG&A.Lawrence SolowSo the $3.6 you referred to in the press release, and just to clarify, and sorry to be annoying but Brad [ph] that's a very good question. The $3.6 you referred to in the text is actually included in the $52.2 million. And then you break out an additional $2.6 million, is that right?David Storch$2.6 million of the $3.6 million is included in the impairment.Lawrence SolowRight. Okay, so that's in the $2.6 million, you already backed out? You backed out the $54 million or whatever the total -- right. So it's only the $1 million that you haven't already backed out? Okay. That's right?David StorchThat's right.OperatorAnd I'm showing no further questions at this time.David StorchLarry, just to be clear. So it's $1 million plus another $400,000 that we indicated. So it's $1.4 million or $1.3 million that gets you to the $0.03, okay? Next question?OperatorI'm showing no further questions in the queue at this time.End of Q&ADavid StorchOkay. Thanks everyone and have a happy holiday. Be well. Bye-bye.OperatorLadies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may all disconnect.
